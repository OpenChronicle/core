Character Management Module

This module provides the consolidated character management system for OpenChronicle,
replacing the previous separate character engines with a unified, modular architecture.

Components:
- character_base.py - Base classes and interfaces
- character_data.py - Unified dataclasses and enums  
- character_storage.py - Character data persistence
- character_orchestrator.py - Main coordinator
- stats/ - Character statistics and behavior
- interactions/ - Relationships and scene management
- consistency/ - Character trait consistency
- presentation/ - Style and model selection
