Character Management Module

This module provides the consolidated character management system for OpenChronicle,
replacing the previous separate character engines with a unified, modular architecture.

Components:
- character_base.py - Base classes and interfaces
- character_data.py - Unified dataclasses and enums  
- character_storage.py - Character data persistence
- character_orchestrator.py - Main coordinator
- character_management_engine.py - Character lifecycle operations
- character_behavior_engine.py - Behavior and response generation
- character_stats_engine.py - Statistics and calculations
- character_validation_engine.py - Validation and consistency
- stats_behavior_engine.py - Statistics-based behavior analysis
- interaction_dynamics_engine.py - Relationships and interactions
- consistency_validation_engine.py - Character trait consistency
- presentation_style_engine.py - Style and presentation management
