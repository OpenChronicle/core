"""
Model Management Package for OpenChronicle.

This package contains the modular components implementing comprehensive
model management with orchestrator pattern.

Components:
- model_orchestrator.py: Main orchestrator for model operations
- response_generator.py: Core response generation logic with fallback support
- lifecycle_manager.py: Adapter initialization and state management
- performance_monitor.py: Performance tracking and analytics
- configuration_manager.py: Configuration and registry management

Architecture:
- Orchestrator Pattern: ModelOrchestrator coordinates all operations
- Single Responsibility: Each component has one clear purpose
- Clean Interfaces: Well-defined APIs between components
- Testability: Each component can be independently tested
- Maintainability: Focused, readable code with clear boundaries
