    Resume a project using event replay to identify interrupted tasks.

    Instead of relying on task table status, this uses ReplayService to derive
    the authoritative list of interrupted tasks from persisted events. An interrupted
    task is one that has a task.started event but no terminal event.

    For each interrupted task:
    1. Check if task.orphaned event already exists (idempotency)
    2. If not, emit task.orphaned event explaining the repair
    3. Transition task status to PENDING

    This operation is idempotent:
    - Calling resume multiple times produces same result
    - task.orphaned events are emitted at most once per task
    - Task table is updated only when needed
