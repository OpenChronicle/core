Application-level LLM execution boundary.

This module enforces routing discipline: all LLM calls in the Application layer
must be anchored to a routing decision. This prevents accidental provider selection
or bypassing of the routing system.

Optional budget enforcement gate ensures projects stay within defined constraints.
