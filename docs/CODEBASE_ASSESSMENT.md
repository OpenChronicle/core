# OpenChronicle v2 — Senior Developer Codebase Assessment

**Date:** 2026-03-18
**Branch:** `main`
**Revision:** 47 (Storytelling Phase 3: conversation mode integration)

---

## Executive Summary

OpenChronicle started as a solution to a real problem: chat context dies between
sessions, and there's no way to carry a narrative (or any LLM interaction) forward
durably. V1 grew into a comprehensive narrative AI engine with 13+ orchestrators,
character AI, and 15+ providers. V2 is a clean-room rebuild recognizing that the
*actual* underlying problem — durable context, explainable routing, and auditable
decisions across LLM interactions — is domain-agnostic.

The core is now **feature-complete for the "core done" milestone.** The full
pipeline works end-to-end: conversation → context assembly → memory retrieval →
provider routing → LLM call → streaming response → turn persistence → event
logging. The CLI has an interactive chat REPL with streaming, conversation
shortcuts (`--resume`, `--latest`), and a clean dispatch-table architecture.
Tests are strong (1,656 unit/functional, 24 real-world integration, 14 Discord
integration, 18 concurrency stress), architecture is enforced, and the STDIO RPC
daemon mode exists. Integration
tests auto-detect application configuration (config directory, provider, credentials
from model configs) via a shared `conftest.py` — only `OC_INTEGRATION_TESTS=1` is
needed to run. The full pipeline has been validated against OpenAI (gpt-4o-mini) and
Anthropic (Claude Sonnet 4) with all 13 integration scenarios passing.

A **concurrency audit** revealed 4 race conditions in the persistence and event
logging layers. All four have been fixed: hash chain forking (`EventLogger.append`
now transactional with timestamp refresh under lock), duplicate turn indices
(`BEGIN IMMEDIATE` serializes writers), and lost updates (`link_memory_to_turn`
wrapped in transaction). Write lock starvation (T4) is fixed with a two-layer
approach: `execute_task()` was split into short transactions so LLM calls no
longer hold the write lock, and `transaction()` now retries `BEGIN IMMEDIATE`
with exponential backoff (3 retries, 0.5–2s delays with jitter) when SQLite's
`busy_timeout` expires. Connection setup uses `isolation_level=None` to bypass
Python's legacy implicit transaction handling, which silently undermined
explicit `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` in multi-threaded scenarios.

Six operational CLI utilities were added to close day-one gaps: `oc version`,
`oc db info|vacuum|backup|stats`, `oc config show`, `oc show-project`,
`oc events`, and `oc convo delete` + `oc memory delete`. These required two
domain port additions (`delete_conversation`, `delete_memory`) with cascade
logic in SqliteStore. CLI command reference documented in `docs/cli/commands.md`.

All subsystems now use three-layer config precedence (env var > `core.json` >
dataclass default). Conversation defaults and Discord operational settings were
the last holdouts — both are now externalized with a hygiene test
(`test_config_completeness.py`) that enforces config-code default synchronization
via `inspect.signature()`.

The **hexagonal boundary** between application and infrastructure layers is now
fully enforced: zero `core.application` → `core.infrastructure` imports.
`CoreContainer` moved to `infrastructure/wiring/`, config utilities moved to
`application/config/`, and concrete infra types replaced with Protocol-based
dependency injection. Posture tests (`test_architectural_posture.py`) verify
core runs without Discord installed, no Discord imports leak inward,
multi-session isolation holds, and the enqueue allowlist stays tight.

A **routing policy bug** was found and fixed: `prepare_ask()`, `execute()`, and
`enqueue()` in `ask_conversation.py` were constructing `RouterPolicy()` with no
arguments (defaulting to `stub:stub-model`), ignoring the configured policy built
by `CoreContainer`. `router_policy` is now a required parameter threaded through
the entire call chain — all callers pass `container.router_policy`. The Ollama
adapter's streaming error handler was also fixed (couldn't read response body on
a streaming `httpx` response without calling `aread()` first).

The Discord bot now writes a **PID file** (`data/discord_bot.pid`) on startup and
cleans it up on shutdown. If a prior instance is still alive, startup exits with
an error. `--force` overrides the check. Cross-platform: uses `PermissionError`
vs generic `OSError` distinction since Windows doesn't raise `ProcessLookupError`.

**HTTP API** (Decision #6) is implemented — FastAPI/uvicorn are core dependencies,
25 REST endpoints mirroring the MCP tool surface, starts automatically with
`oc serve` in a daemon thread. Includes API key auth (timing-safe), per-client
rate limiting (thread-safe sliding window), optional CORS, and proper HTTP error
codes. Shared serializers (`interfaces/serializers.py`) eliminate duplication
between MCP tools and API routes.

**Enterprise tightening — Pass A (Error Handling + Validation) is complete.**
Domain exception taxonomy (`NotFoundError`, `ValidationError`) with global
FastAPI exception handlers (404, 422, 400, 500). ~30 use-case sites migrated
from bare `ValueError`. Pydantic `Field()` constraints on all request models,
`Query()` constraints on all query parameters. Rowcount checks in sqlite_store
(3 update methods + TOCTOU fix). File path validation in `upload_asset`.
32 new tests.

**Enterprise tightening — Pass B (Operational Hardening + DRY Extraction) is complete.**
DRY extraction: `utc_now()` in `domain/time_utils.py` (replaced 6 duplicate
`_utc_now()` functions + 2 cross-file imports), `parse_csv_tags()` in
`env_helpers.py` (replaced 5 inline tag-parsing sites). LLM adapter timeouts:
`timeout_seconds` parameter on all 5 adapters, wired from `ResolvedModelConfig.timeout`
via `OC_LLM_TIMEOUT` env var fallback. Container lifecycle: `SqliteStore.close()`,
`CoreContainer.close()`, context manager protocol, partial-init cleanup.
Config validation: `__post_init__` on `ConversationSettings`, `MoESettings`,
`TelemetrySettings`, `HTTPConfig` (boundary value enforcement). CORS tightened
from `allow_methods=["*"]` to explicit list. Logging added to 12 use cases + 2
services; silent exception handlers in `continue_project` and `export_convo` now
log with `_logger.exception()`. Ollama adapter: specific `json.JSONDecodeError`
catch, `PROVIDER_ERROR` code for HTTP errors. Error codes normalized: all 13
lower_snake values changed to SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE. CLI bug: removed unreachable
code in `cmd_memory_delete`, added error handling to `cmd_memory_pin`.
49 new tests, 1177 total passing.

**Enterprise tightening — Pass C (Interface Hardening + API/MCP Parity) is complete.**
API/MCP parity: `POST /api/v1/conversation/search-turns` closes the last REST
mirror gap (MCP `search_turns` tool had no HTTP equivalent). Path parameter
validation: `Annotated[str, Path(min_length=1, max_length=200)]` on all API path
params (`conversation_id`, `memory_id`, `asset_id`). System route validation:
`Query(max_length=...)` on `tool_stats` and `moe_stats` query params. MCP tool
validation: input clamping (`top_k`, `offset`, `limit`, `turn_limit`,
`memory_limit`) and rejection (empty `query`, empty `content`, overlength
`content`/`prompt`) across 7 MCP tools — uses graceful clamping for numeric
bounds (MCP callers are LLM agents), hard rejection for clearly invalid inputs.
Gemini adapter error codes: `_classify_gemini_error()` maps exceptions to
`TIMEOUT`, `CONNECTION_ERROR`, `PROVIDER_ERROR`, or `UNKNOWN_ERROR` (was `None`).
`OLLAMA_HOST` documented in env vars reference.
21 new tests, 1198 total passing.

**Storytelling plugin Phase 3 (conversation mode integration) is done.** Plugins can
now register **mode prompt builders** — callables that produce custom system prompts
when a conversation is in their mode. The storytelling plugin registers a `"story"`
mode builder: when a conversation's `mode` is set to `"story"`, `prepare_ask()`
delegates system prompt construction to the plugin, which assembles characters,
style guides, locations, worldbuilding, and scene context from project memory via
tag-filtered search. Generic keyword-based memory retrieval is skipped (the builder
does its own retrieval); pinned memories are still included. New CLI convenience
commands: `oc story characters`, `oc story locations`, `oc story search`. 20 new
tests, 1767 total.

**What's next:** Multimodal conversation input (vision input via asset system),
or Phase 5 IDE automation hooks (prototype exists). Plugin development lives in
[openchronicle/plugins](https://github.com/OpenChronicle/plugins). Media generation is done
(Decision #7) — `MediaGenerationPort` with 5 adapters (stub, Ollama, OpenAI
gpt-image-1, Gemini dual-surface, xAI Grok Imagine). Ollama CLI model management
is done — `oc ollama list|show|add|remove|sync` with capability inference from
Ollama API metadata (vision via clip, diffusion via safetensors, tools via template).

MoE (Mixture-of-Experts) execution strategy is implemented — Jaccard-based
consensus scoring, `--moe` CLI/MCP flag, quality pool parallel execution, 32 tests.
MCP server (Decision #5) is implemented — unblocks Goose + Serena triangle, VS
Code integration, and any MCP-compatible client. MCP tool usage tracking and MoE
usage tracking provide operational observability — dedicated tables, aggregate
stats queries, `tool_stats` and `moe_stats` MCP tools.

**Overall: Core feature-complete, Discord + MCP + HTTP API interfaces operational, MoE consensus execution implemented, MCP/MoE usage tracking operational, config fully externalized, hex boundaries enforced, concurrency-safe for multi-process deployment. Memory system Phase 3 complete: embedding-based semantic search via provider-agnostic `EmbeddingPort` (stub, OpenAI, Ollama adapters), hybrid FTS5+cosine retrieval combined via Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF), embeddings stored as BLOB in SQLite with CASCADE cleanup, backfill CLI/MCP/API, backwards-compatible default (keyword-only when `OC_EMBEDDING_PROVIDER=none`). Embedding observability added: health endpoint reports embedding status (active/disabled/failed with coverage stats), startup logging on adapter init, per-item backfill resilience with error isolation, configurable timeout via `OC_EMBEDDING_TIMEOUT`. Phase 4 Webhook Service complete: outbound webhooks with HMAC-SHA256 signing, background dispatcher thread with queue + exponential backoff retry, composite `emit_event` pattern (zero call-site changes), fnmatch glob event filtering, recursion prevention. Phase 5 IDE automation hooks prototyped: Claude Code `PreCompact` and `SessionStart(compact)` hooks inject OC memories around context compression via `oc memory search --full`. Media generation complete: `MediaGenerationPort` with 5 adapters (stub, Ollama, OpenAI gpt-image-1, Gemini dual-surface, xAI Grok Imagine), unified model config with `image_generation` capability tag (no separate `OC_MEDIA_PROVIDER`), asset storage with SHA-256 dedup, CLI/MCP/API interfaces. Model config system extended with `type` and `description` fields, `find_media_model()`/`list_by_capability()` lookup methods. Plugins separated to [openchronicle/plugins](https://github.com/OpenChronicle/plugins) repo. Ollama CLI model management: `oc ollama list|show|add|remove|sync` with capability inference from Ollama API metadata, operates against resolved config directory. Storytelling plugin Phase 3 (conversation mode integration): plugins register mode prompt builders via `PluginRegistry`, `prepare_ask()` delegates system prompt construction to the active mode's builder, story builder assembles characters/style guides/locations/worldbuilding from project memory; CLI convenience commands `oc story characters|locations|search`. 30 MCP tools, 39 REST endpoints, 1,767 tests. Enterprise tightening Passes A/B/C complete. OpenAI-compatible API layer added: `/v1/models` + `/v1/chat/completions` (streaming + non-streaming) for Open WebUI and other OpenAI-compatible clients, `provider/model` routing format, 53 unit tests + 12 API stress tests. Known issue: `_get_or_create_webui_session` has a read-then-write race under multi-connection concurrency (tracked in BACKLOG.md).**

## Project Origin and Evolution

Understanding where this project came from is essential for making good decisions
about where it goes.

### The Arc

1. **Personal pain point** — Chat sessions die. Stories lose continuity between
   sessions. No LLM tool provides durable multi-session context.

2. **V1: Storytelling framework** — Built durable memory, character AI, timeline
   rollback, scene management, image generation. 13+ orchestrators, 15+ providers.
   Comprehensive but monolithic. Plugins leaked into core.

3. **Generalization insight** — The memory/context/routing infrastructure isn't
   story-specific. Any LLM interaction benefits from durable context, explainable
   routing, and auditable decisions.

4. **V2: Clean-room rebuild** — Strip to a domain-agnostic orchestration core.
   Hexagonal architecture (enforced by tests). Hash-chained events. Plugin-based
   extensibility. Rebuild v1 features as plugins on a stable foundation.

5. **Evolution within v2** — Early v2 was "pure platform" (core does nothing,
   plugins do everything). Then LLM orchestration moved to core. Then the default
   UX pivoted from manager/worker to conversation-first. Memory v0, explainability,
   and privacy gates were added. Manager/worker became optional/advanced.

### What Never Changed

- Hexagonal architecture, enforced by tests
- Determinism and auditability as product features
- Loud failures, no spooky defaults
- Local-first, provider-agnostic
- No soft deprecation, no tech debt breadcrumbs
- Core stays standalone; everything else is plugins

### What Evolved

- Manager/worker: "the default" → "optional advanced layer"
- Server mode: HTTP socket → STDIO RPC (what shipped)
- Primary UX: task orchestration → conversation-first
- Memory: unmentioned → "dumb but correct" keyword-based v0

## Current State: What Works

### End-to-End Conversation Pipeline (Functional)

The complete flow works today:

```text
User prompt
  → Conversation lookup + turn history assembly
  → Pinned memory retrieval
  → Keyword-based memory search
  → System prompt construction with memory context + time context
  → Interaction routing (rule-based + optional ML assist)
  → Privacy gate check (optional PII detection)
  → Provider/model selection via routing policy
  → LLM call with fallback execution
  → Response capture + metadata parsing
  → Atomic turn persistence (index, text, provider, model, routing reasons)
  → Event emission (hash-chained, tamper-evident)
  → Telemetry recording (tokens, latency, memory usage)
```

This is tested end-to-end in `test_conversation_flow.py`, `test_smoke_live.py`,
and the 13-scenario real-world integration suite (`test_real_world.py`) which
validates against live providers (OpenAI, Anthropic).

### Architecture (Enforced and Clean)

```text
interfaces/ (CLI, RPC, Discord, MCP, API)
    ↓ calls
application/ (use cases, orchestrator, policies, routing, config)
    ↓ depends on
domain/ (models, ports, services)
    ↑ implements
infrastructure/ (LLM adapters, SQLite, privacy, router assist, wiring)
```

Boundary discipline enforced by `test_hexagonal_boundaries.py` (5 tests) and
`test_architectural_posture.py` (24 tests): domain imports nothing outward,
application imports nothing from infrastructure, core imports nothing from
any interface layer. Composition root (`CoreContainer`) lives in `infrastructure/wiring/`.

Enforced by: `test_hexagonal_boundaries.py`, `test_core_agnosticism.py`,
`test_policies_purity.py`. Domain has zero infrastructure imports. Application has
zero SDK imports. This is genuinely enforced, not aspirational.

## Core Gaps (All Resolved)

The following gaps were identified at the start of the v2 rebuild and have all
been closed. Kept here for architectural context — see Definition of Done and
Refactoring Priorities sections for implementation details.

| # | Gap | Resolution |
| --- | ----- | ------------ |
| 1 | No interactive chat experience | `oc chat` REPL with auto-create, `--resume`, streaming (e368db4) |
| 2 | No streaming responses | `stream_async()` on LLMPort + all 6 adapters (6416c76) |
| 3 | God Functions in interface layer | Dispatch tables in `cli/commands/` + `rpc_handlers.py` (e368db4) |
| 4 | Manager/worker methods need decomposition | Phase-separated into 6 private helpers + dataclass (f4416d0) |
| 5 | `ask_conversation.execute()` too large | Split into `prepare_ask()` / `finalize_turn()` pipeline (95cab4c) |

---

## Concurrency Issues (Audited and Fixed)

The persistence and event logging layers were originally written for
single-connection access. A concurrency audit identified 4 race conditions, all
proven exploitable by `test_stress.py`. All four have been fixed.

| # | Issue | Fix | Status |
| --- | ------- | ----- | -------- |
| 1 | **Hash chain fork** — `EventLogger.append()` read-compute-write race | Wrapped in `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` transaction + timestamp refresh under lock | **Fixed** |
| 2 | **Duplicate turn index** — `next_turn_index()` reads MAX in deferred BEGIN | `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` serializes all write transactions | **Fixed** |
| 3 | **Lost memory link** — `link_memory_to_turn()` JSON read-modify-write race | Wrapped in `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` transaction | **Fixed** |
| 4 | **Write lock starvation** — long transaction blocks all writers | Short transactions + application-level retry with exponential backoff in `transaction()` | **Fixed** |

Additional fixes applied during implementation:

- **`isolation_level=None`** on connection setup — Python's legacy implicit
  transaction handling silently undermined explicit `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` in
  multi-threaded scenarios. Uses `isolation_level=None` (works on Python 3.11+)
  instead of the 3.12+-only `autocommit` attribute. Explicit `COMMIT`/`ROLLBACK`
  via `execute()` instead of `conn.commit()`/`conn.rollback()`.
- **Timestamp refresh under lock** — events constructed before lock acquisition
  had `created_at` timestamps that didn't match serialization order, causing
  `ORDER BY created_at` to return stale `prev_hash` values.

**Multi-process safe.** Scheduler service, Discord driver, and concurrent
processes can now share the database.

## Definition of Done: Core v2

"Core done" means: a fully operational daemon that you can interact with like a
chatbot via CLI, with durable memory, explainable routing, and a stable plugin
surface. No backwards compatibility concerns. No production deployment yet.

### Must Have (Blocking for "Core Done")

| # | Item | Status | Why It's Blocking |
| --- | ------ | -------- | ------------------- |
| 1 | **Interactive chat REPL** (`oc chat`) | Done (e368db4) | Can't "interact like a chatbot" without it |
| 2 | **Streaming responses** (LLMPort + adapters + CLI, with `--no-stream` toggle) | Done (6416c76) | Chatbot UX with 10s wait for response is broken |
| 3 | **Interface layer refactoring** (God Functions → dispatch tables) | Done (e368db4) | Untestable interface layer is a stability risk |
| 4 | **Conversation UX shortcuts** (auto-create, resume latest, etc.) | Done (a946e7c) | UUID juggling prevents casual use |

### Should Have (Quality, Not Functionality)

| # | Item | Status | Impact |
| --- | ------ | -------- | -------- |
| 5 | **Decompose `ask_conversation.execute()`** | Done | Testability, readability |
| 6 | **Decompose orchestrator manager/worker methods** | Done | Phase-separated into 6 private helpers + dataclass |
| 7 | **SqliteStore row mapper extraction** | Done | Cognitive load reduction |

### Defer to Plugin Phase

| Item | Reason |
| ------ | -------- |
| ~~HTTP API~~ | ✅ Core interface (`interfaces/api/`, FastAPI, always-on daemon) |
| ONNX router assist | Linear model works; ONNX is a performance optimization |
| Embeddings / vector memory search | Keyword search works for v0; embeddings are a plugin concern |
| ~~Docker hardening~~ | ✅ CI builds multi-arch image to `ghcr.io/openchronicle/core` on push to main |
| ~~Scheduler~~ | ✅ Core service (`application/services/scheduler.py`, 53 tests) |
| ~~Discord driver~~ | ✅ Interfaces driver (`interfaces/discord/`, 85 tests, optional extra) |
| ~~OC MCP Server~~ | ✅ Interfaces driver (`interfaces/mcp/`, 30 tools, 44+7 tests, optional extra) |

## What "Core Done" Looks Like in Practice

```bash
# Bootstrap (one-time)
oc init

# Start the daemon
oc serve &

# Start chatting (interactive REPL)
oc chat
> Hello! What can you help me with?
Assistant: I can help with a variety of tasks...  [streams token by token]
> Remember that I prefer Python for code examples
[Memory saved: "User prefers Python for code examples"]
> /explain
[Shows: provider=openai, model=gpt-4o, memory items retrieved: 3, routing: quality pool]
> /quit

# Resume later
oc chat --resume
> What programming language do I prefer?
Assistant: You prefer Python for code examples.  [memory retrieval working]

# Or use one-shot commands
oc convo ask --latest "Quick question about X"

# Or drive programmatically via RPC
echo '{"command":"convo.ask","args":{...}}' | oc rpc

# Plugins extend without modifying core
oc plugin list
oc task submit --handler story.draft --input '{"prompt":"..."}'
```

---

## Refactoring Priorities (Ordered)

### Phase 1: Interface Layer — DONE (e368db4)

- `main.py` split from 1,852 → ~350 lines via `cli/commands/` dispatch tables
- `stdio.py` split into `rpc_handlers.py` (18 handlers) + slim dispatch
- `oc chat` REPL built with auto-create, `--resume`, streaming

### Phase 2: Streaming — DONE (6416c76)

- `StreamChunk` dataclass + `stream_async()` on `LLMPort` with fallback default
- Native streaming in all 6 adapters (stub, OpenAI, Anthropic, Groq, Gemini, Ollama)
- `stream_with_route()` execution boundary + `_stream_turn()` in chat REPL
- `--no-stream` opt-out toggle

### Phase 3: Conversation UX — DONE (a946e7c)

- Auto-create conversations in `oc chat`
- `oc chat --resume` picks up most recent conversation
- `oc convo ask/show/export --latest` resolves most recent conversation

### Phase 4: Internal Quality — DONE

**4a. Decompose `ask_conversation.execute()`** — Done. Extracted into
`prepare_ask()` (phases 1-5), `finalize_turn()` (phases 7-9), and
`_record_error_telemetry()`. `execute()` is now a ~35-line orchestrator.
Streaming path in `chat.py` rewritten to use the full pipeline (memory,
privacy, routing, telemetry).

**4b. Decompose orchestrator manager/worker methods** — Done. Extracted
`_WorkerRoutingContext` dataclass, `_resolve_worker_modes` (4-way mode
resolution), and 5 `_worker_*` phase helpers. `_run_worker_summarize` is now a
~20-line orchestrator calling setup → budget → rate-limit → execute → record.
`_run_analysis_summary` uses `_resolve_worker_modes` (~85 lines, down from ~119).

**4c. Extract SqliteStore row mappers** — Done. Extracted 10 `_row_to_*` methods
and `_parse_dt` to `row_mappers.py` as module-level functions. 21 callsites
updated. `sqlite_store.py` reduced by ~165 lines.

---

## What's Working Well (Don't Touch)

- **Hexagonal architecture enforcement tests** — These are the immune system
- **Hash-chained event model** — Core differentiator, enables verification/replay
- **Provider routing/pool system** — Most polished subsystem (1,278-line test suite)
- **Config-driven adapter wiring** — JSON configs, env fallbacks, lazy instantiation
- **Zero-tolerance test policies** — no tech debt markers, no soft deprecation, no secrets
- **STDIO RPC protocol spec** — Well-designed integration contract for future clients
- **Plugin system simplicity** — `register()` + handler functions (v1's complex
  plugins were a mistake)
- **Privacy gate** — 6 PII categories, Luhn validation, provider-aware. Blocking
  dependency for Discord integration
- **Memory v0** — "Dumb but correct" keyword search is the right starting point
- **`archive/openchronicle.v1` branch** — Preserved as design reference and plugin feature roadmap

---

## Subsystem Detail

### Use Case Layer (27 files, ~2,924 lines)

The use case layer has a healthy distribution: 16 thin wrappers (~328 lines total)
that forward to ports, and 8 complex orchestration files (~2,393 lines) with real
business logic. This is correct architecture — not everything needs to be complex.

**Heavyweights:**

| File | Lines | Complexity |
| ------ | ------- | ------------ |
| `ask_conversation.py` | 936 | Full conversation turn orchestration |
| `smoke_live.py` | 360 | End-to-end provider testing |
| `task_once.py` | 333 | Task execution with error handling |
| `selftest_run.py` | 330 | Comprehensive workflow testing |
| `replay_project.py` | 283 | Event replay engine |
| `diagnose_runtime.py` | 283 | Runtime diagnostics |
| `explain_turn.py` | 267 | Turn analysis via event correlation |
| `resume_project.py` | 160 | Orphaned task recovery |

**Concern:** The boundary between "what belongs in a use case" vs "what belongs in
the orchestrator" is unclear. `run_task.py` is 28 lines (pure forwarding) while
`ask_conversation.py` is 936 lines (full orchestration). The orchestrator also owns
built-in handler logic that could be use cases.

### Domain Layer (15 models, 9 ports, 3 services)

Clean and well-typed. Key models:

- **`Project`, `Agent`, `Task`, `Event`** — Core execution entities with hash chains
- **`Conversation`, `Turn`** — Chat interaction history with full metadata per turn
- **`MemoryItem`** — Persistent knowledge with tags, pinning, conversation/project scope
- **`BudgetPolicy`, `TaskRetryPolicy`** — Policy-as-data pattern
- **`InteractionHint`, `RouterAssistResult`** — Routing decision outputs

Ports define clean contracts: `StoragePort` (38 methods), `ConversationStorePort`
(12 methods, including cascade delete), `MemoryStorePort` (8 methods, including
delete with turn reference cleanup), `LLMPort` (2 methods), plus single-method
ports for routing, privacy, and plugin hosting.

**Concern:** `StoragePort` at 38 abstract methods is doing too much. The task tree
navigation methods feel like read-model concerns that could be a separate port.

### Infrastructure Layer

**Complete:** SQLite persistence (13 tables, crash recovery, transactions), privacy
gate (6 PII categories), rule routing (NSFW + mode detection), hybrid routing
(rule + ML), linear router assist (logistic regression), event logger (hash chains),
file-based configuration (single `core.json` with three-layer precedence:
dataclass defaults → JSON file → env var override; enriched model configs with
limits, capabilities, cost tracking, and performance metadata; per-plugin JSON config).

**Stub only:** ONNX router assist (intentional placeholder).

### Test Suite (152 files, 1656 unit/functional + 24 real-world integration + 14 Discord integration + 18 concurrency stress)

Well-organized into 12 categories: business logic (23), CLI/RPC (23), hygiene (11),
infrastructure (11), contract (8), policy (5), memory (5), architecture guard (4),
advanced (5), data format (4), plugin (2), integration (4 + conftest).

**Real-world integration** (`test_real_world.py`): 13 scenarios exercising the
full stack against live LLM providers — single/multi-turn, memory save/recall,
pinned memory, hash chain verification, token tracking, event chain completeness,
privacy gate PII detection, conversation resume, export with verify/explain,
streaming vs non-streaming, and conversation mode. Validated against OpenAI
(gpt-4o-mini) and Anthropic (Claude Sonnet 4). Manual checklist covers
interactive features (streaming visual, chat resume, quit, diagnose).

**Discord integration** (`test_discord_integration.py`): 14 scenarios exercising the
Discord bot's glue code against real infrastructure — session creation/reuse,
multi-user isolation, `/newconvo` flow, memory save/recall via Discord path,
stale session auto-recovery, event chain integrity verification, plus 7 realistic
user session simulations (casual greeting, factual Q&A, context retention,
conversation reset, multi-turn task coherence, concurrent user isolation, and
turn persistence verification).

**Integration test auto-detection** (`tests/integration/conftest.py`): Session-scoped
conftest auto-detects the application's config directory (well-known deployment paths
with `models/*.json`, e.g. `C:\Docker\openchronicle\config`), LLM provider (from env
vars or model config scan), and credentials (embedded in model config JSON files).
Only `OC_INTEGRATION_TESTS=1` is needed to run — no manual `OC_CONFIG_DIR` or
`OC_LLM_PROVIDER` setup. Explicit env vars always take precedence. Smoke tests
(`test_smoke_live.py`) adapted to handle config-embedded credentials (skip
credential-removal tests when keys aren't in env vars).

**Concurrency stress tests** (`test_stress.py`): 6 threading-based tests using
separate `SqliteStore` connections to the same database file (simulating
multi-process access). Each thread gets its own `sqlite3.Connection` with
independent locks and WAL snapshots. Results:

| Test | Target | Outcome |
| ------ | -------- | --------- |
| T1: Hash chain fork | `EventLogger.append()` read-compute-write race | **pass** — 300 events, chain intact, no collisions |
| T2: Duplicate turn index | `next_turn_index()` + deferred BEGIN | **pass** — 10 turns, distinct indices |
| T3: Lost update | `link_memory_to_turn()` JSON read-modify-write | **pass** — all 10 memory IDs survive |
| T4: Write lock starvation | Long transaction blocks other writers | **pass** — application-level retry recovers after holder releases |
| T5: Independent chains (baseline) | Concurrent writes to different task_ids | **pass** — database fundamentally sound |
| T6: Scheduler tick no double-fire | Concurrent `tick()` atomic claiming | **pass** — 20 jobs, each fired exactly once |

**OpenAI-compat API stress tests** (`test_openai_stress.py`): 12 tests exercising
the full HTTP → container → storage pipeline via FastAPI TestClient with real
SqliteStore and stubbed LLM. Concurrent tests use per-thread `CoreContainer`
instances (separate SQLite connections to the same DB file). Results:

| Test | Target | Outcome |
| ------ | -------- | --------- |
| S1: WebUI session race | `_get_or_create_webui_session` read-then-write | **xfail** — race confirmed, duplicate sessions created |
| S2: Concurrent turn recording | Turn index uniqueness under 10 concurrent writes | **pass** — all indices unique and sequential |
| S3: Rapid-fire sequential | 50 sequential requests, state consistency | **pass** — all turns recorded, indices monotonic |
| S4: Streaming turn recording | 10 concurrent streaming requests, buffered text | **pass** — all turns recorded with complete text |
| S5: Mixed streaming + non-streaming | 5 streaming + 5 non-streaming concurrent | **pass** — all 10 turns recorded, no corruption |
| S6: Multi-project isolation | 5 projects × 5 concurrent requests | **pass** — no cross-project contamination |
| S7: Explicit vs auto-session | Interleaved explicit + auto-session requests | **pass** — turns land in correct conversations |
| S8: Event chain integrity | 10 concurrent requests, hash chain verification | **pass** — event chain intact |
| S9: Memory injection consistency | 20 memories + 10 concurrent context assemblies | **pass** — no errors, memories unchanged |
| S10: V1/V2 isolation | 5 V1 + 5 V2 concurrent requests | **pass** — V1 no turns, V2 records turns |
| S11: Invalid input flood | 20 concurrent requests, ~50% invalid | **pass** — correct error codes, valid requests succeed |
| S12: Conversation growth | 100 sequential turns, large history | **pass** — context assembly works, indices correct |

**Strongest coverage:** Provider routing, budget enforcement, conversation flow,
event verification, architectural boundaries, live provider validation,
concurrency race conditions.

Interface layer was split into dispatch tables (e368db4), unlocking
command-level testing.

## V1 → V2: What Changed and Why

| V1 Feature | V2 Status | Notes |
| ------------ | ----------- | ------- |
| 13+ orchestrators | 1 orchestrator + use cases | Intentional simplification |
| 15+ LLM providers | 5 providers (async-native) | OpenAI, Anthropic, Groq, Gemini, Ollama |
| Character AI | Not ported | Plugin territory |
| Timeline rollback | Hash-chained events | Cryptographic > database integrity |
| Multi-tier memory (Redis + SQLite) | Single-tier SQLite | Simpler, may need tiers later |
| Content analysis (two-tier LLM) | Router assist (linear/ONNX) | Lighter weight |
| Scene management, narrative engines | Not ported | Plugin territory |
| Image generation | Not ported | Plugin territory |
| Plugin: full domain/app/infra per plugin | Plugin: handler + register() | Intentionally simpler |
| Web UI templates | Not ported | HTTP API is core; web UI is separate concern |
| CLI commands only | CLI + STDIO RPC daemon | Headless operation enabled |
| Database integrity | Cryptographic integrity | Hash-chained events are the upgrade |

**The v2 strategy is correct:** Build a hardcore core with clean boundaries, then
re-implement v1 features as plugins. The `archive/openchronicle.v1` branch is both
historical context and a feature roadmap for the plugin phase.

## Post-Core Roadmap

A plugin-readiness audit (2026-02-13) identified that the plugin system works for
stateless task handlers but cannot support stateful, long-running, or
service-dependent features. See Decision #4 below for the architectural response.
Enriched plugin handler context (2026-03-02) addresses the stateful gap for
connector-style plugins: handlers now receive pre-bound `memory_save`,
`memory_search`, `memory_update`, `llm_complete`, and `plugin_config` closures
in their context dict. Plugins never import core internals — all capabilities
are injected at invocation time.

Generic inbound hooks endpoint (2026-03-02) adds `POST /api/v1/hooks/{handler_name}`
to the HTTP API — a fire-and-forget webhook receiver that validates the handler
exists, parses JSON or multipart form-data, submits a `plugin.invoke` task, and
returns 202 with the task ID. Execution happens in a FastAPI `BackgroundTasks`
callback. 5 tests.

Connector plugins (Plex, Plaid) are developed in the
[openchronicle/plugins](https://github.com/OpenChronicle/plugins) repo.

Core Done
  ✓ LLMPort: function calling / tool use (done)
  ✓ Scheduler (core — application/services)
  ✓ Discord Driver (core — interfaces/)
  ✓ OC MCP Server (core — interfaces/mcp, Decision #5)
  ✓ Docker CI (ghcr.io/openchronicle/core, multi-arch, GitHub Actions)
  ✓ MoE Mode (core — application/services/moe_execution.py, uses LLMPort + routing)
  ✓ HTTP API (core — interfaces/api, always-on daemon, Decision #6)
  ✓ Capability-Aware Routing (core — wire model config capabilities into routing)
  ✓ Media Generation (core — MediaGenerationPort, 5 adapters, unified model config, Decision #7)
  ✓ Ollama CLI (core — oc ollama list|show|add|remove|sync, capability inference, config management)
  → Multimodal Conversation Input (core — vision input via asset system)
  ✓ Webhooks (core — webhook_service.py + webhook_dispatcher.py, HMAC signing, background dispatch)
  ✓ Embedding Observability (health status, startup logging, backfill resilience, configurable timeout)
  ✓ Inbound Hooks Endpoint (core — interfaces/api/routes/hooks.py, generic POST dispatch to plugin handlers)
  ~ Phase 5 IDE Hooks (prototype — Claude Code PreCompact/SessionStart hooks, `oc memory search --full`)
  → Security Scanner (plugin — stateless handler)
  → Dev Agent Runner (core — needs LLM + sandbox)
  → Serena MCP (core — inside sandbox only)
  ✓ Memory Embeddings (core — EmbeddingPort, hybrid FTS5+cosine search via RRF)
  → VS Code / Copilot SDK (MCP client or external via RPC)
  → Goose Integration (MCP client — uses OC MCP + Serena MCP)
  → Private Git Server (plugin or external)
```

**Taxonomy:** Features that need persistent state, lifecycle hooks, or direct
service access are core features (in `application/` or `interfaces/`). Stateless
input→output handlers remain plugins. External clients compose via MCP or STDIO
RPC. See Decision #5 for the MCP-first integration strategy.

## Resolved Decisions

### 1. Manager/worker stays in core (Decision: 2026-02-12)

**Decision:** Keep manager/worker in core, decompose the methods.

**Rationale:** Manager/worker is a **runtime capability**, like multi-threading —
not every workflow uses it, but it's the kind of thing that belongs in the engine.
Plugins shouldn't have to reimplement task parallelism and worker coordination.

**Action:** Decompose `_run_worker_summarize()` (339 lines) and
`_run_analysis_summary()` (119 lines) into phase-separated methods (setup, prompt
building, LLM call, result parsing, worker spawning). No architectural change,
just internal readability.

### 2. Streaming is must-have, with opt-out toggle (Decision: 2026-02-12)

**Decision:** Streaming is blocking for core-done. Non-streaming remains as an
option via `--no-stream` flag / `OC_STREAM=0` env var.

**Rationale:** A chatbot without streaming feels broken in 2026. But programmatic
callers (RPC, Discord driver) and user preference may want complete responses.
Both paths need to work.

**Action:** Add `stream_async()` to `LLMPort`, implement in all 5 adapters, wire
through CLI (`oc chat`, `oc convo ask`). RPC gets both `convo.ask` (existing,
complete response) and `convo.ask_stream` (chunked). Non-streaming path is not
throwaway — it stays as the default for RPC and as the user opt-out.

### 3. Memory self-report: keep lenient, remove strict mode (Decision: 2026-02-12)

**Decision:** Keep self-report as opt-in lenient telemetry. Remove strict mode.
Invest further only alongside memory v1 (embeddings).

**Rationale:** Memory is the core product feature — OpenChronicle exists because
chat context dies between sessions. Knowing whether injected memory is actually
being used by the LLM is critical signal for validating that the product works.
Self-report via `<OC_META>` blocks is the cheapest available feedback mechanism.

However, it depends entirely on LLM compliance, which varies by model. Strict
mode punishes the user for something outside their control (LLM formatting). A
bad self-report should log a warning, never fail a turn.

**What self-report is:** V0 of a memory effectiveness feedback loop. The data
collected now (even noisy) becomes baseline data for future approaches:
retrieval relevance scoring, response analysis, A/B testing with/without memory.

**What self-report is NOT:** A correctness mechanism. The turn succeeds regardless.

**Action:** Remove strict mode code path. Keep lenient self-report as opt-in
telemetry. Surface usage data in `--explain` output. Revisit when building memory
v1 (embeddings/vector search) — self-report data will inform retrieval quality.

### 4. Hybrid plugin taxonomy: core vs plugin vs external (Decision: 2026-02-13)

**Decision:** Scheduler and Discord driver are core features, not plugins. The
plugin system stays as-is for stateless task handlers.

**Rationale:** A plugin-readiness audit found the plugin API provides
`(task, context) → result` with minimal context (`agent_id`, `attempt_id`,
`emit_event`). Stateful features need persistent storage, lifecycle hooks, direct
service access, event subscription, and configuration — all of which the plugin
API lacks. Building a mini-framework inside the plugin API to support these would
duplicate what core already provides.

The scheduler is a **runtime concern** (like the event logger or transaction
retry). The Discord driver is an **interface** (like CLI or STDIO RPC). Neither
is an optional bolt-on — they need the same level of access as core services.

**Taxonomy:**

| Feature needs... | Lives in... | Examples |
| ------------------ | ------------- | ---------- |
| Persistent state, lifecycle, service access, or LLM orchestration | Core (`application/` or `interfaces/`) | Scheduler, Discord, MCP server, HTTP API, Dev Agent Runner, MoE Mode |
| Stateless input→output processing | Plugin ([openchronicle/plugins](https://github.com/OpenChronicle/plugins)) | Story generation, analysis, formatting, security scan |
| External process composing via MCP or RPC | External client | Goose, VS Code, Claude Desktop, CI integrations |

**Action:** Build scheduler in `application/services/`, Discord driver in
`interfaces/discord/`. Keep the plugin system for what it's good at. Close one
core gap first: add function calling / tool use to LLMPort (done — ToolDefinition,
ToolCall, tool_calls on LLMResponse/StreamChunk, tools/tool_choice params on all
6 adapters + facade + execution layer, 53 contract tests).

### 5. MCP-first integration strategy: OC as an MCP server (Decision: 2026-02-20)

**Decision:** Build an OC MCP server as a core interface (`interfaces/mcp/`).
This is the primary integration path for external agents (Goose, VS Code, Claude
Desktop) rather than requiring each to implement a custom STDIO RPC client.

**Rationale:** Three tools compose naturally:

| Tool | Role | Persistence |
| ------ | ------ | ------------- |
| **Serena** (MCP server) | Code understanding — what the code **is** | Stateless |
| **OpenChronicle** (MCP server) | Persistent memory — what was **decided** and **why** | Persistent |
| **Goose** (MCP client) | Agent execution — edit files, run commands, iterate | Ephemeral |

Goose already speaks MCP. Serena is already an MCP server. Making OC an MCP
server completes the triangle with zero custom glue code per client. Any
MCP-compatible agent gets persistent memory and conversation capabilities.

The MCP server is a transport layer exposing existing core capabilities (memory
ports, `AskConversation`, health checks) — same category as CLI, STDIO RPC, and
Discord. It needs direct access to `CoreContainer` and the full port surface,
so it cannot be a plugin (same reasoning as Decision #4 for Discord).

**What this changes in the roadmap:**

- **OC MCP Server** becomes next priority after security scanner (or parallel).
  16 tools, maps 1:1 to existing ports/use cases.
- **Goose integration** no longer requires Dev Agent Runner, Security Scanner,
  or Sandbox Runner as prerequisites. Goose connects to OC MCP server directly.
- **VS Code / Copilot SDK** can also connect via MCP instead of custom RPC
  client.
- **Dev Agent Runner** remains on the roadmap as an upgrade path where OC
  orchestrates Goose (flipped control, full audit trail via event chain).

**Architecture:**

```text
interfaces/mcp/
  server.py           # MCP server setup, tool registration
  tools/
    memory.py         # memory_search, memory_save, memory_list, memory_pin, memory_update, memory_get, memory_delete, memory_stats
    conversation.py   # conversation_ask, conversation_history, conversation_list, conversation_create
    context.py        # context_recent
    system.py         # health, tool_stats, moe_stats, search_turns, onboard_git
    asset.py          # asset_upload, asset_list, asset_get, asset_link
    webhook.py        # webhook_register, webhook_list, webhook_delete
    project.py        # project_create, project_list
```

**Posture:** Optional extra (`.[mcp]`). Core runs without MCP SDK. All MCP
imports lazy, confined to `interfaces/mcp/`. Enforced by posture tests.

**Spec:** [`docs/integrations/mcp_server_spec.md`](integrations/mcp_server_spec.md)

### 6. HTTP API is always-on core infrastructure (Decision: 2026-02-22)

**Decision:** The HTTP API is a core interface that starts automatically as part
of `oc serve`. FastAPI and uvicorn are core dependencies, not an optional extra.
The implementation lives in `interfaces/api/`.

**Rationale:** The HTTP API is the same tier as CLI, STDIO RPC, Discord, and
MCP — an interface layer that needs the full `CoreContainer`. It is not an
optional bolt-on because:

1. **Daemon infrastructure.** When OC runs as a daemon, the HTTP API is always
   listening. Webhooks (both inbound and outbound) depend on it. External
   integrations (connectors, plugins with route registration) compose through it.
2. **Plugin route registration.** Plugins can register HTTP routes (mounted under
   `/api/v1/plugins/` namespace), enabling webhook consumption and custom
   endpoints without modifying core.
3. **Standard REST surface.** Mirrors MCP tools 1:1 as REST endpoints, plus
   streaming (SSE), webhooks, and plugin routes. Any HTTP client gets the same
   capabilities as MCP clients.

Unlike Discord and MCP (optional extras with lazy imports), the HTTP API has no
optional SDK dependency — FastAPI is lightweight and always installed. No posture
test for "core runs without HTTP API" because it is core infrastructure.

**Architecture:**

```text
interfaces/api/
  app.py              # FastAPI app factory (create_app(container, config))
  config.py           # HTTPConfig (host, port, auth settings)
  middleware/
    auth.py            # API key / token auth
    privacy.py         # Privacy gate middleware
    rate_limit.py      # Per-client rate limiting
  routes/
    memory.py          # /api/v1/memory/*
    conversation.py    # /api/v1/conversation/*
    project.py         # /api/v1/project/*
    asset.py           # /api/v1/asset/*
    webhook.py         # /api/v1/webhook/*
    system.py          # /api/v1/health, /api/v1/stats
```

**Posture:** Core dependency (not optional). Hexagonal boundary enforced — no
`core.*` module imports from `interfaces/api/`.

### 7. Media generation is a core capability (Decision: 2026-02-22, Implemented: 2026-02-25)

**Decision:** Media generation (image, video) is a core capability with its own
port (`MediaGenerationPort`), adapters, and unified model config. Not a plugin.

**Rationale:** Media generation needs:

1. **Its own port.** Different input/output types from text completion (prompts →
   binary media), different cost model, different routing needs. Extending
   `LLMPort` would violate interface segregation.
2. **Unified model config.** Media models live in `config/models/` alongside LLM
   models with `"image_generation": true` capability tag. Provider is derived
   from the model config — no separate `OC_MEDIA_PROVIDER` env var. Single knob:
   `OC_MEDIA_MODEL`.
3. **Asset integration.** Generated media flows through the existing asset system
   (SHA-256 dedup, generic linking). A use case orchestrates port + asset storage.
4. **Provider adapters.** Ollama (Flux diffusion), OpenAI (gpt-image-1), Google
   (Gemini native + Imagen dual-surface), xAI (Grok Imagine). Each normalizes
   to `MediaResult`.

**Architecture:**

```text
core/domain/models/media.py                   # MediaRequest, MediaResult
core/domain/ports/media_generation_port.py    # Port ABC
core/infrastructure/media/
  stub_adapter.py                              # Testing (deterministic PNG)
  ollama_adapter.py                            # Ollama /api/generate (diffusion)
  openai_adapter.py                            # OpenAI /v1/images/generations
  gemini_adapter.py                            # Gemini dual-surface (native + Imagen)
  xai_adapter.py                               # xAI Grok Imagine (OpenAI-compatible)
core/application/use_cases/generate_media.py   # Orchestrates port + asset storage
config/models/ollama_flux.json                 # image_generation capability
config/models/openai_gpt_image_1.json          # image_generation capability
config/models/gemini_flash_image_gen.json      # image_generation capability
config/models/xai_grok_imagine.json            # image_generation capability
```

**Model config extensions:** `ModelConfigEntry` gained `type` (default `"llm"`,
media models use `"media"`) and `description` fields. `ModelConfigLoader` gained
`find_media_model()`, `list_by_capability()`, and `find_by_model()` methods.

**Implementation:** Complete. 5 adapters, CLI/MCP/API interfaces, 69 tests.
