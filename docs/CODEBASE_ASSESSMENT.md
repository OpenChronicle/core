# OpenChronicle v2 — Senior Developer Codebase Assessment

**Date:** 2026-02-12
**Branch:** `refactor/new-core-from-scratch`
**Revision:** 3 (core done — all 4 must-haves complete)

---

## Executive Summary

OpenChronicle started as a solution to a real problem: chat context dies between
sessions, and there's no way to carry a narrative (or any LLM interaction) forward
durably. V1 grew into a comprehensive narrative AI engine with 13+ orchestrators,
character AI, and 15+ providers. V2 is a clean-room rebuild recognizing that the
*actual* underlying problem — durable context, explainable routing, and auditable
decisions across LLM interactions — is domain-agnostic.

The core is now **feature-complete for the "core done" milestone.** The full
pipeline works end-to-end: conversation → context assembly → memory retrieval →
provider routing → LLM call → streaming response → turn persistence → event
logging. The CLI has an interactive chat REPL with streaming, conversation
shortcuts (`--resume`, `--latest`), and a clean dispatch-table architecture.
Tests are strong (404+), architecture is enforced, and the STDIO RPC daemon
mode exists.

**What's next** is the plugin phase (scheduler, Discord driver, security scanner)
and optional should-have refactoring (decompose `ask_conversation.execute()`,
orchestrator methods, SqliteStore row mappers).

**Overall: Core done.** Both backend and UX are at the "you can use this as a
chatbot" bar. Remaining work is polish and extensibility.

## Project Origin and Evolution

Understanding where this project came from is essential for making good decisions
about where it goes.

### The Arc

1. **Personal pain point** — Chat sessions die. Stories lose continuity between
   sessions. No LLM tool provides durable multi-session context.

2. **V1: Storytelling framework** — Built durable memory, character AI, timeline
   rollback, scene management, image generation. 13+ orchestrators, 15+ providers.
   Comprehensive but monolithic. Plugins leaked into core.

3. **Generalization insight** — The memory/context/routing infrastructure isn't
   story-specific. Any LLM interaction benefits from durable context, explainable
   routing, and auditable decisions.

4. **V2: Clean-room rebuild** — Strip to a domain-agnostic orchestration core.
   Hexagonal architecture (enforced by tests). Hash-chained events. Plugin-based
   extensibility. Rebuild v1 features as plugins on a stable foundation.

5. **Evolution within v2** — Early v2 was "pure platform" (core does nothing,
   plugins do everything). Then LLM orchestration moved to core. Then the default
   UX pivoted from manager/worker to conversation-first. Memory v0, explainability,
   and privacy gates were added. Manager/worker became optional/advanced.

### What Never Changed

- Hexagonal architecture, enforced by tests
- Determinism and auditability as product features
- Loud failures, no spooky defaults
- Local-first, provider-agnostic
- No soft deprecation, no tech debt breadcrumbs
- Core stays standalone; everything else is plugins

### What Evolved

- Manager/worker: "the default" → "optional advanced layer"
- Server mode: HTTP socket → STDIO RPC (what shipped)
- Primary UX: task orchestration → conversation-first
- Memory: unmentioned → "dumb but correct" keyword-based v0

## Current State: What Works

### End-to-End Conversation Pipeline (Functional)

The complete flow works today:

```text
User prompt
  → Conversation lookup + turn history assembly
  → Pinned memory retrieval
  → Keyword-based memory search
  → System prompt construction with memory context
  → Interaction routing (rule-based + optional ML assist)
  → Privacy gate check (optional PII detection)
  → Provider/model selection via routing policy
  → LLM call with fallback execution
  → Response capture + metadata parsing
  → Atomic turn persistence (index, text, provider, model, routing reasons)
  → Event emission (hash-chained, tamper-evident)
  → Telemetry recording (tokens, latency, memory usage)
```

This is tested end-to-end in `test_conversation_flow.py` and `test_smoke_live.py`.

### Infrastructure Inventory

| Subsystem | Status | Evidence |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| **5 LLM providers** (OpenAI, Anthropic, Groq, Gemini, Ollama) | Working | Async-native adapters, contract tests |
| **Provider routing** (pools, fallback, NSFW, budget-aware) | Working | 1,278-line test suite |
| **SQLite persistence** (10 tables, 48 methods, WAL mode) | Working | Handles tasks, conversations, memory, events |
| **Hash-chained events** (SHA256, prev_hash → hash) | Working | Verification + replay services |
| **Privacy gate** (6 PII categories, Luhn validation) | Working | Rule-based, provider-aware |
| **Interaction routing** (rule + hybrid ML assist) | Working | NSFW scoring, mode detection |
| **Memory v0** (keyword search, pinned, tagged) | Working | Deterministic retrieval, no embeddings |
| **Budget/rate limiting** | Working | Token limits, call limits, rate gates |
| **Plugin system** (discover, load, register, invoke) | Working | 2 example plugins, collision detection |
| **STDIO RPC** (18 commands, serve + oneshot) | Working | Request dedup, telemetry, error codes |
| **CLI** (50+ subcommands) | Working | Project/task/convo/memory/diagnostics |
| **Config-driven wiring** (JSON model configs, env vars) | Working | Per-(provider, model) resolution |
| **Test suite** (400+ tests, 93 files) | Passing | 12 test categories, architecture guards |

### Architecture (Enforced and Clean)

```text
interfaces/ (CLI, RPC, API stub)
    ↓ calls
application/ (use cases, orchestrator, policies, routing)
    ↓ depends on
domain/ (models, ports, services)
    ↑ implements
infrastructure/ (LLM adapters, SQLite, privacy, router assist)
```

Enforced by: `test_hexagonal_boundaries.py`, `test_core_agnosticism.py`,
`test_policies_purity.py`. Domain has zero infrastructure imports. Application has
zero SDK imports. This is genuinely enforced, not aspirational.

---

## Current State: What's Missing

### 1. No Interactive Chat Experience

The CLI requires this to have a conversation:

```bash
oc convo create --title "My Chat"
# → outputs conversation_id (UUID)
oc convo ask --conversation-id 550e8400-... "Hello, how are you?"
# → outputs response
oc convo ask --conversation-id 550e8400-... "Tell me more"
# → outputs response
```

**What "interact like a chatbot" requires:**

```bash
oc chat
# → enters interactive REPL
# → auto-creates or resumes conversation
You: Hello, how are you?
Assistant: I'm doing well! How can I help you today?
You: Tell me more about X
Assistant: ...
```

This is the single biggest UX gap. The backend supports it — conversations, turns,
memory all work. There's just no interactive shell wrapping it.

### 2. No Streaming Responses

`LLMPort.complete_async()` returns a complete `LLMResponse`. There's no streaming
API. For a chatbot experience, watching tokens arrive is table stakes — especially
for long responses that take 10+ seconds.

All 5 provider SDKs support streaming natively. The port interface would need a
`stream_async()` method returning an async iterator of chunks.

### 3. God Functions in Interface Layer

| Function | File | Lines | Problem |
|----------|------|-------|---------|
| `main()` | `interfaces/cli/main.py` | **1,574** | All 50+ CLI commands in one function |
| `dispatch_json_command()` | `interfaces/cli/stdio.py` | **974** | All 18 RPC commands in one function |

These make the interface layer untestable in isolation and fragile to change.
Every new command means editing a function that's already 1,000+ lines.

**This matters for "core done" because:** Plugins don't add CLI commands (they use
`plugin.invoke`), but core maintenance and future core commands (like `oc chat`)
need a clean interface layer. The God Functions also prevent proper command-level
unit testing.

### 4. Manager/Worker Methods Need Decomposition

`OrchestratorService` (831 lines) contains `_run_worker_summarize()` (339 lines)
and `_run_analysis_summary()` (119 lines). These implement the manager/worker
pattern — a core runtime capability (like multi-threading) that stays in core.

The conversation flow bypasses these methods — `ask_conversation.py` calls
`execute_with_route()` directly. But manager/worker is available for task-based
workflows and future plugins that need parallel execution.

**Resolved:** Stays in core. Methods need internal decomposition into phases
(setup, prompt building, LLM call, result parsing, worker spawning) for
readability and testability. See Resolved Decisions section.

### 5. `ask_conversation.execute()` — 444 Lines in One Function

This is the core conversation workflow. It works correctly but does too much in one
function: context assembly, memory retrieval, routing, privacy gate, LLM call,
response parsing, turn persistence, telemetry. Decomposing into 3-4 helper
functions would make it testable and readable without changing behavior.

---

## Definition of Done: Core v2

"Core done" means: a fully operational daemon that you can interact with like a
chatbot via CLI, with durable memory, explainable routing, and a stable plugin
surface. No backwards compatibility concerns. No production deployment yet.

### Must Have (Blocking for "Core Done")

| # | Item | Status | Why It's Blocking |
|---|------|--------|-------------------|
| 1 | **Interactive chat REPL** (`oc chat`) | Done (e368db4) | Can't "interact like a chatbot" without it |
| 2 | **Streaming responses** (LLMPort + adapters + CLI, with `--no-stream` toggle) | Done (6416c76) | Chatbot UX with 10s wait for response is broken |
| 3 | **Interface layer refactoring** (God Functions → dispatch tables) | Done (e368db4) | Untestable interface layer is a stability risk |
| 4 | **Conversation UX shortcuts** (auto-create, resume latest, etc.) | Done (a946e7c) | UUID juggling prevents casual use |

### Should Have (Quality, Not Functionality)

| # | Item | Status | Impact |
|---|------|--------|--------|
| 5 | **Decompose `ask_conversation.execute()`** | Not started | Testability, readability |
| 6 | **Decompose orchestrator manager/worker methods** | Not started | 339+119 lines in two methods need phase separation |
| 7 | **SqliteStore row mapper extraction** | Not started | Cognitive load reduction |

### Defer to Plugin Phase

| Item | Reason |
|------|--------|
| HTTP API | CLI + RPC cover the chatbot use case |
| ONNX router assist | Linear model works; ONNX is a performance optimization |
| Embeddings / vector memory search | Keyword search works for v0; embeddings are a plugin concern |
| Docker hardening | Not needed until deployment |
| Scheduler plugin | First plugin after core done |
| Discord driver | Needs scheduler first |

---

## What "Core Done" Looks Like in Practice

```bash
# Bootstrap (one-time)
oc init

# Start the daemon
oc serve &

# Start chatting (interactive REPL)
oc chat
> Hello! What can you help me with?
Assistant: I can help with a variety of tasks...  [streams token by token]
> Remember that I prefer Python for code examples
[Memory saved: "User prefers Python for code examples"]
> /explain
[Shows: provider=openai, model=gpt-4o, memory items retrieved: 3, routing: quality pool]
> /quit

# Resume later
oc chat --resume
> What programming language do I prefer?
Assistant: You prefer Python for code examples.  [memory retrieval working]

# Or use one-shot commands
oc convo ask --latest "Quick question about X"

# Or drive programmatically via RPC
echo '{"command":"convo.ask","args":{...}}' | oc rpc

# Plugins extend without modifying core
oc plugin list
oc task submit --handler story.draft --input '{"prompt":"..."}'
```

---

## Refactoring Priorities (Ordered)

### Phase 1: Interface Layer — DONE (e368db4)

- `main.py` split from 1,852 → ~350 lines via `cli/commands/` dispatch tables
- `stdio.py` split into `rpc_handlers.py` (18 handlers) + slim dispatch
- `oc chat` REPL built with auto-create, `--resume`, streaming

### Phase 2: Streaming — DONE (6416c76)

- `StreamChunk` dataclass + `stream_async()` on `LLMPort` with fallback default
- Native streaming in all 6 adapters (stub, OpenAI, Anthropic, Groq, Gemini, Ollama)
- `stream_with_route()` execution boundary + `_stream_turn()` in chat REPL
- `--no-stream` opt-out toggle

### Phase 3: Conversation UX — DONE (a946e7c)

- Auto-create conversations in `oc chat`
- `oc chat --resume` picks up most recent conversation
- `oc convo ask/show/export --latest` resolves most recent conversation

### Phase 4: Internal Quality (Should-Have, Not Started)

**4a. Decompose `ask_conversation.execute()`** — Extract context assembly, memory
retrieval, LLM interaction, and telemetry recording into helper functions.

**4b. Decompose orchestrator manager/worker methods** — 339+119 lines need phase
separation. Decision resolved: stays in core as runtime capability.

**4c. Extract SqliteStore row mappers** — Move 11 `_row_to_*` methods to a
`row_mappers.py` module.

---

## What's Working Well (Don't Touch)

- **Hexagonal architecture enforcement tests** — These are the immune system
- **Hash-chained event model** — Core differentiator, enables verification/replay
- **Provider routing/pool system** — Most polished subsystem (1,278-line test suite)
- **Config-driven adapter wiring** — JSON configs, env fallbacks, lazy instantiation
- **Zero-tolerance test policies** — no tech debt markers, no soft deprecation, no secrets
- **STDIO RPC protocol spec** — Well-designed integration contract for future clients
- **Plugin system simplicity** — `register()` + handler functions (v1's complex
  plugins were a mistake)
- **Privacy gate** — 6 PII categories, Luhn validation, provider-aware. Blocking
  dependency for Discord integration
- **Memory v0** — "Dumb but correct" keyword search is the right starting point
- **`v1.reference/` directory** — Keep as design reference and plugin feature roadmap

## Subsystem Detail

### Use Case Layer (27 files, ~2,924 lines)

The use case layer has a healthy distribution: 16 thin wrappers (~328 lines total)
that forward to ports, and 8 complex orchestration files (~2,393 lines) with real
business logic. This is correct architecture — not everything needs to be complex.

**Heavyweights:**

| File | Lines | Complexity |
|------|-------|------------|
| `ask_conversation.py` | 758 | Full conversation turn orchestration |
| `smoke_live.py` | 360 | End-to-end provider testing |
| `task_once.py` | 333 | Task execution with error handling |
| `selftest_run.py` | 330 | Comprehensive workflow testing |
| `replay_project.py` | 283 | Event replay engine |
| `diagnose_runtime.py` | 283 | Runtime diagnostics |
| `explain_turn.py` | 267 | Turn analysis via event correlation |
| `resume_project.py` | 160 | Orphaned task recovery |

**Concern:** The boundary between "what belongs in a use case" vs "what belongs in
the orchestrator" is unclear. `run_task.py` is 28 lines (pure forwarding) while
`ask_conversation.py` is 758 lines (full orchestration). The orchestrator also owns
built-in handler logic that could be use cases.

### Domain Layer (12 models, 8 ports, 3 services)

Clean and well-typed. Key models:

- **`Project`, `Agent`, `Task`, `Event`** — Core execution entities with hash chains
- **`Conversation`, `Turn`** — Chat interaction history with full metadata per turn
- **`MemoryItem`** — Persistent knowledge with tags, pinning, conversation/project scope
- **`BudgetPolicy`, `TaskRetryPolicy`** — Policy-as-data pattern
- **`InteractionHint`, `RouterAssistResult`** — Routing decision outputs

Ports define clean contracts: `StoragePort` (28+ methods), `ConversationStorePort`
(11 methods), `MemoryStorePort` (6 methods), `LLMPort` (2 methods), plus single-
method ports for routing, privacy, and plugin hosting.

**Concern:** `StoragePort` at 28+ abstract methods is doing too much. The task tree
navigation methods feel like read-model concerns that could be a separate port.

### Infrastructure Layer

**Complete:** SQLite persistence (10 tables, crash recovery, transactions), privacy
gate (6 PII categories), rule routing (NSFW + mode detection), hybrid routing
(rule + ML), linear router assist (logistic regression), event logger (hash chains),
configuration (settings dataclasses + env vars).

**Stub only:** ONNX router assist (intentional placeholder).

**Not started:** Streaming in LLM adapters.

### Test Suite (93 files, 400+ tests)

Well-organized into 12 categories: business logic (23), CLI/RPC (15), hygiene (10),
infrastructure (10), contract (8), policy (5), memory (5), architecture guard (4),
advanced (5), data format (4), plugin (2), integration (2).

**Strongest coverage:** Provider routing, budget enforcement, conversation flow,
event verification, architectural boundaries.

**Gap:** Interface layer is largely untested in isolation due to God Functions.
Splitting them would unlock proper command-level testing.

## V1 → V2: What Changed and Why

| V1 Feature | V2 Status | Notes |
|------------|-----------|-------|
| 13+ orchestrators | 1 orchestrator + use cases | Intentional simplification |
| 15+ LLM providers | 5 providers (async-native) | OpenAI, Anthropic, Groq, Gemini, Ollama |
| Character AI | Not ported | Plugin territory |
| Timeline rollback | Hash-chained events | Cryptographic > database integrity |
| Multi-tier memory (Redis + SQLite) | Single-tier SQLite | Simpler, may need tiers later |
| Content analysis (two-tier LLM) | Router assist (linear/ONNX) | Lighter weight |
| Scene management, narrative engines | Not ported | Plugin territory |
| Image generation | Not ported | Plugin territory |
| Plugin: full domain/app/infra per plugin | Plugin: handler + register() | Intentionally simpler |
| Web UI templates | Not ported | HTTP API deferred |
| CLI commands only | CLI + STDIO RPC daemon | Headless operation enabled |
| Database integrity | Cryptographic integrity | Hash-chained events are the upgrade |

**The v2 strategy is correct:** Build a hardcore core with clean boundaries, then
re-implement v1 features as plugins. The `v1.reference/` directory is both
historical context and a feature roadmap for the plugin phase.

## Plugin Roadmap (Post Core-Done)

```text
Core Done
  → Scheduler Plugin (P0) — unlocks all downstream plugins
  → Discord Driver (P1) — first external client
  → Security Scanner (P2) — gitleaks/osv-scanner/trivy
  → Dev Agent Runner (P3) — sandboxed execution
  → Serena MCP (P3.2) — inside sandbox only
  → MoE Mode (P4) — multi-expert consensus
  → HTTP API (infra) — FastAPI/Flask
  → VS Code / Copilot SDK (P5.1)
  → Goose Integration (P5.2)
  → Private Git Server (P6)
```

Each plugin composes on core via STDIO RPC. Core stays standalone.

---

## Resolved Decisions

### 1. Manager/worker stays in core (Decision: 2026-02-12)

**Decision:** Keep manager/worker in core, decompose the methods.

**Rationale:** Manager/worker is a **runtime capability**, like multi-threading —
not every workflow uses it, but it's the kind of thing that belongs in the engine.
Plugins shouldn't have to reimplement task parallelism and worker coordination.

**Action:** Decompose `_run_worker_summarize()` (339 lines) and
`_run_analysis_summary()` (119 lines) into phase-separated methods (setup, prompt
building, LLM call, result parsing, worker spawning). No architectural change,
just internal readability.

### 2. Streaming is must-have, with opt-out toggle (Decision: 2026-02-12)

**Decision:** Streaming is blocking for core-done. Non-streaming remains as an
option via `--no-stream` flag / `OC_STREAM=0` env var.

**Rationale:** A chatbot without streaming feels broken in 2026. But programmatic
callers (RPC, Discord driver) and user preference may want complete responses.
Both paths need to work.

**Action:** Add `stream_async()` to `LLMPort`, implement in all 5 adapters, wire
through CLI (`oc chat`, `oc convo ask`). RPC gets both `convo.ask` (existing,
complete response) and `convo.ask_stream` (chunked). Non-streaming path is not
throwaway — it stays as the default for RPC and as the user opt-out.

### 3. Memory self-report: keep lenient, remove strict mode (Decision: 2026-02-12)

**Decision:** Keep self-report as opt-in lenient telemetry. Remove strict mode.
Invest further only alongside memory v1 (embeddings).

**Rationale:** Memory is the core product feature — OpenChronicle exists because
chat context dies between sessions. Knowing whether injected memory is actually
being used by the LLM is critical signal for validating that the product works.
Self-report via `<OC_META>` blocks is the cheapest available feedback mechanism.

However, it depends entirely on LLM compliance, which varies by model. Strict
mode punishes the user for something outside their control (LLM formatting). A
bad self-report should log a warning, never fail a turn.

**What self-report is:** V0 of a memory effectiveness feedback loop. The data
collected now (even noisy) becomes baseline data for future approaches:
retrieval relevance scoring, response analysis, A/B testing with/without memory.

**What self-report is NOT:** A correctness mechanism. The turn succeeds regardless.

**Action:** Remove strict mode code path. Keep lenient self-report as opt-in
telemetry. Surface usage data in `--explain` output. Revisit when building memory
v1 (embeddings/vector search) — self-report data will inform retrieval quality.
