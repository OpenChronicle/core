# CLAUDE.md

## Project Status File

**`docs/CODEBASE_ASSESSMENT.md`** — single source of truth for this project.

## Project-Specific Notes

- **No backwards compatibility.** Personal project, no public users, no production.
  Break whatever needs breaking.

## Current Sprint

**Status:** Core done. Post-core features in progress. Hybrid taxonomy decided:
scheduler and Discord are core features, not plugins (Decision #4 in assessment).
See [docs/CODEBASE_ASSESSMENT.md](docs/CODEBASE_ASSESSMENT.md) for full status.

**Next action:** Security scanner plugin, dev agent runner, or Goose integration
(MCP server now unblocks all three).
MCP server is done (`interfaces/mcp/`, 10 tools, 21 tests + 7 posture, `oc mcp serve`
CLI, stdio + SSE transports, lazy import guard).
Discord interface is done (`interfaces/discord/`, `commands.Bot` subclass, 6 slash
commands, session mapping, message splitting, 60 tests, `oc discord start` CLI).
Scheduler service is done (tick-driven, atomic claim, 52+ tests, CLI + RPC).
LLMPort function calling/tool use is done (all 6 adapters, 30 contract tests).
Time context injection is done (current time, last interaction timestamp,
seconds delta — raw data in every conversation turn for bot time awareness).
File-based config is done (single `core.json`, enriched model configs, plugin
configs co-located at `plugins/<name>/config.json`).
Config externalization is done (conversation defaults + Discord operational
settings wired through three-layer precedence, hygiene test prevents drift).

## Build and Development

```bash
# Install in development mode
pip install -e ".[dev]"

# With optional LLM providers
pip install -e ".[openai]"    # OpenAI support
pip install -e ".[ollama]"    # Ollama support

```

## Testing

```bash
# Run all tests (excludes integration tests by default)
pytest

# Run all checks (what pre-commit does)
pre-commit run --all-files
```

## Architecture

Python 3.11+ project using **hexagonal architecture**: `domain/` (pure business
logic, ports) -> `application/` (use cases, policies, orchestration) ->
`infrastructure/` (LLM adapters, persistence, routing). CLI and API live in
`interfaces/`. See [docs/architecture/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/architecture/ARCHITECTURE.md)
for the full directory tree and layer descriptions.

**Key Concepts:**

- **Ports**: Abstract interfaces in `domain/ports/` that infrastructure implements
- **Event Model**: Hash-chained events for tamper-evident task timelines (`prev_hash` -> `hash`)
- **Task Handlers**: Async functions registered by handler name (e.g., `hello.echo`, `story.draft`)
- **Plugins**: Discovered from `plugins/` directory, loaded via `importlib.util`
- **Routing**: Provider/model selection via pools (fast, quality, nsfw) with fallback support
- **Scheduler**: Core service in `application/services/scheduler.py` (not a plugin)
- **Discord**: Interfaces driver in `interfaces/discord/` (optional extra, not a plugin)
- **MCP Server**: Interfaces driver in `interfaces/mcp/` (optional extra, 10 tools, FastMCP)

## Conventions

**Naming:**

- Event types: dot-separated lowercase (`llm.requested`, `task.completed`)
- Task types: use `plugin.invoke` with handler in payload (not dotted task types)
- Handler names: dot-separated lowercase (`story.draft`, `hello.echo`)
- Error codes: SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE (`INVALID_ARGUMENT`, `BUDGET_EXCEEDED`)

**Patterns:**

- All task handlers are async functions
- Strict typing enforced by mypy
- Domain models use `@dataclass`
- Tests use pytest fixtures; integration tests marked with `@pytest.mark.integration`

**Secrets:**

- Zero secrets in repo (enforced by `test_no_secrets_committed.py`)
- Use `.env.local` (git-ignored) or `config/` directory for secrets
- Test placeholders: `changeme`, `replace_me`, `your_key_here`, `test-key`

## Environment Variables

Most-used variables for quick reference:

| Variable | Purpose | Default |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `OC_LLM_PROVIDER` | Provider selection (`stub`, `openai`, `ollama`, `anthropic`) | `stub` |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | OpenAI authentication | - |
| `OC_DB_PATH` | SQLite database location | `data/openchronicle.db` |

## OpenChronicle Memory Integration

OC is available as an MCP server. It provides persistent memory that
survives context compression and session boundaries. **Use it.**

Context compression loses the "why" — decisions made, approaches
rejected, working state, user preferences expressed mid-session. The
status doc (`CODEBASE_ASSESSMENT.md`) tracks project-level state but
not conversational context. OC memory fills that gap.

### Setup

Configure in `.claude/settings.json` (project-level):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "openchronicle": {
      "command": "oc",
      "args": ["mcp", "serve"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Project Identity

Use `project_id: "openchronicle-core"` in all `memory_save` calls.

### Session Protocol Addition

After the standard session protocol (Serena onboarding, status doc,
CLAUDE.md sprint), add:

- Call `memory_search` with keywords relevant to the current task or
  the user's first message. Review results for prior decisions,
  rejected approaches, and working context from previous sessions.

This step is **especially critical after context compression**, where
the compression summary is a lossy snapshot. OC memory is the lossless
record.

### When to Save

Call `memory_save` when any of these happen during a session:

- **Decision made.** Architecture, design, or approach chosen. Include
  what was decided, alternatives considered, and the reasoning.
- **Approach rejected.** Something was tried and didn't work. Save what
  it was, why it failed, and what replaced it.
- **Milestone completed.** A feature or significant unit of work is done.
  Summarize what was built and any non-obvious gotchas.
- **User preference expressed.** The user states a workflow preference,
  convention, or standing instruction that isn't already in CLAUDE.md
  or working-style.md.
- **Scope change.** The user redirects mid-task. Save what changed and
  why, so future sessions don't re-tread the old path.
- **Pre-compression.** If a session is getting long (many tool calls,
  complex multi-step work), proactively save working context — what
  we're doing, where we are in it, what's left. Don't wait to be asked.
  There is no hook for compression; the only mitigation is saving early.

**Tagging convention:**

| Tag | When |
|-----|------|
| `decision` | Architectural or design decisions |
| `rejected` | Approaches tried and abandoned |
| `milestone` | Completed work summaries |
| `context` | Working state snapshots (proactive saves) |
| `convention` | Patterns, preferences, recurring gotchas |
| `scope` | Scope changes and reprioritizations |

Pin memories that represent standing rules or conventions.

**Don't save:**

- Routine file edits or commands (too granular, no retrieval value)
- Anything already captured in `docs/CODEBASE_ASSESSMENT.md`
- Speculative plans that haven't been confirmed by the user

### When to Load

Call `memory_search` at these points:

- **Session start / post-compression.** Search for the current task
  topic. This is non-negotiable after compression.
- **Before starting a new area of work.** Check if prior context exists.
- **When something feels familiar.** If a problem seems like it was
  discussed before, search before re-deriving from scratch.

### Tools to Use / Avoid

| Tool | Use | Notes |
|------|-----|-------|
| `memory_save` | **Yes** | Primary persistence mechanism |
| `memory_search` | **Yes** | Primary retrieval mechanism |
| `memory_list` | Occasionally | Browse recent memories when search terms are unclear |
| `memory_pin` | Yes | Pin standing conventions and rules |
| `context_recent` | Occasionally | Catch up on prior OC activity |
| `health` | Rarely | Diagnostics only |
| `conversation_ask` | **Never** | Routes through a second LLM — you ARE the LLM |
| `conversation_*` | **No** | Not needed for Claude Code use case |

### Known Gaps

- **No compression hook.** We can't detect when compression is about to
  happen. Mitigation: save-as-you-go discipline.
- **Search is keyword-based.** Quality depends on good content and tags.
  Write memories as if future-you is searching for them with obvious
  keywords.
- **Untested in real sessions.** This integration is new. If memory
  retrieval isn't useful, or save cadence is wrong, flag it so we can
  iterate on these rules.
