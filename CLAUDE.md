# CLAUDE.md

## Project Status File

**`docs/CODEBASE_ASSESSMENT.md`** — single source of truth for this project.

## Project-Specific Notes

- **No backwards compatibility.** Personal project, no public users, no production.
  Break whatever needs breaking.
- **`main` is v2.** The v1 codebase is archived on `archive/openchronicle.v1`.
  The `refactor/new-core-from-scratch` branch no longer exists — all development
  happens on `main`.

## Current Sprint

**Status:** Core done. Connector plugin model retired (2026-04-29 incident).
OpenChronicle is now positioned as an MCP server with narrow extension support
for behavior-modifying plugins (storytelling). Domain integrations (Plex, etc.)
belong as their own MCP servers, composed by the client.
See [docs/CODEBASE_ASSESSMENT.md](docs/CODEBASE_ASSESSMENT.md) for full status.

**Next action:** Rebrand evaluation (`OpenChronicle/openchronicle-core` →
`carldog/openchronicle-mcp`), backlog reclassification (extension /
external-MCP / core lens), Open WebUI compat decision (drop
`openai_compat.py`?). Plugin development for `storytelling` lives in
[openchronicle/plugins](https://github.com/OpenChronicle/plugins).
Media generation is done (`MediaGenerationPort` with 5 adapters:
stub, Ollama, OpenAI gpt-image-1, Gemini dual-surface, xAI Grok Imagine; unified model
config with `image_generation` capability tag; `OC_MEDIA_MODEL` derives provider; 69 tests).
Ollama CLI is done (`oc ollama list|show|add|remove|sync`, capability inference from
Ollama API, operates against resolved config dir, 32 tests).
Capability-aware routing is done (`ModelConfigLoader` parses capabilities,
`RouterPolicy` filters by `required_capabilities`, `NO_CAPABLE_MODEL` error, 12 tests).
HTTP API is done (`interfaces/api/`, FastAPI, 39 REST endpoints mirroring MCP tools,
API key auth, rate limiting, shared serializers, 51+ tests, auto-starts with `oc serve`).
OpenAI-compatible API layer is done (`interfaces/api/routes/openai_compat.py`,
`GET /v1/models` + `POST /v1/chat/completions` with streaming, model routing via
`provider/model` format, 53 unit tests + 12 API stress tests).
Known issue: `_get_or_create_webui_session` has a read-then-write race under
multi-connection concurrency (tracked in BACKLOG.md).

LLMPort function calling/tool use is done (all 6 adapters, 53 contract tests).
Time context injection is done (current time, last interaction timestamp,
seconds delta — raw data in every conversation turn for bot time awareness).
File-based config is done (single `core.json`, enriched model configs, plugin
configs co-located at `plugins/<name>/config.json`).
Memory System Phase 1 is done (`memory_update` use case with `updated_at` tracking,
tag-filtered search with AND logic on `search_memory`, 19 new tests).
Memory System Phase 1.1 is done (interface parity: `memory_get`/`delete`/`stats` on MCP + API,
pagination with `offset`, source index, streaming telemetry fix, observability events
`memory.search_completed` + `context.assembly_breakdown`, 27 new tests).
Config externalization is done (conversation defaults + Discord operational
settings wired through three-layer precedence, hygiene test prevents drift).
Docker CI is done (GitHub Actions multi-arch build to `ghcr.io/openchronicle/core`,
`latest` + SHA tags, GHA cache, `.gitattributes` for LF shell scripts).
Enterprise Tightening Pass A is done (domain exceptions `NotFoundError`/`ValidationError`,
global FastAPI exception handlers, Pydantic `Field()`/`Query()` input validation,
sqlite_store rowcount checks, file path validation, ~30 use-case migration sites,

service refactored from `prepare_ask`, incremental `onboard_git` with watermark tracking,
`list_memory_by_source` promoted to `MemoryStorePort`, 39 new tests, 1237 total).

`OC_DATA_DIR`-derived > default, `SqliteStore`/`AssetFileStorage` defaults removed,
`CoreContainer`/CLI/Discord all wired through `RuntimePaths.resolve()`, Docker
entrypoint expanded, 12 new tests).
Embedding observability is done (health endpoint reports embedding status
active/disabled/failed with coverage stats, startup INFO logging on adapter init,
per-item backfill resilience with error isolation, configurable timeout via
`OC_EMBEDDING_TIMEOUT` env var / `embedding.timeout` core.json key, 1438 total).
Plugin repo separation is done (plugins now at
[openchronicle/plugins](https://github.com/OpenChronicle/plugins), 9 doc files
updated, core's `plugins/` dir still works via `OC_PLUGIN_DIR`).
Phase 5 IDE automation hooks prototype is done (Claude Code `PreCompact` hook
injects OC context memories before compression, `SessionStart(compact)` hook
reloads after compression, `--full` flag on `oc memory search` for
machine-readable context injection, hooks in `.claude/hooks/` gitignored).
Storytelling Plugin Phase 3 is done (conversation mode integration: `ModePromptBuilder`
protocol in `PluginRegistry` port, `prepare_ask()` delegates system prompt to active
mode's builder, story builder assembles characters/style guides/locations/worldbuilding
from project memory via tag-filtered search, `make_memory_search_closure` extracted to
`context_builder.py`, CLI `oc story characters|locations|search`, 20 new tests, 1767 total).

consistency checking and emotional arc analysis, persona extractor stub with text-only
extraction; 13 new files, 12 new handlers, 11 new CLI commands, 208 new tests, 1975 total).
2026-04-29 incident remediation + connector model retired (production DB
`memory_embeddings` B-tree corruption recovered via Plan B rebuild —
plex memory items stripped, 49 non-plex items preserved, integrity_check ok;
`hello_plugin`/`plaid_connector`/`plex_connector` deleted from `plugins/` along
with 8 dedicated test files; 4 fixture-using tests migrated from `hello.echo` to
`story.draft`; storytelling plugin gained `PLUGIN_ID`/`NAME`/`VERSION`/`ENTRYPOINT`
metadata constants — contract was previously enforced only via hello_plugin;
`/data` migrated from Windows bind-mount to Docker named volume `oc-data` to fix
SQLite WAL fsync risk on bind-mount FS; root cause: plex webhook bombardment +
unclean container restart on bind-mount = torn checkpoint write; 1921 tests pass).

## Architecture

Python 3.11+ project using **hexagonal architecture**: `domain/` (pure business
logic, ports) -> `application/` (use cases, policies, orchestration) ->
`infrastructure/` (LLM adapters, persistence, routing). CLI and API live in
`interfaces/`. See [docs/architecture/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/architecture/ARCHITECTURE.md)
for the full directory tree and layer descriptions.

**Key Concepts:**

- **Ports**: Abstract interfaces in `domain/ports/` that infrastructure implements
- **Event Model**: Hash-chained events for tamper-evident task timelines (`prev_hash` -> `hash`)
- **Task Handlers**: Async functions registered by handler name (e.g., `story.draft`)
- **Plugins**: Loaded from `OC_PLUGIN_DIR` (default `plugins/`), via `importlib.util`. Plugin development happens in [openchronicle/plugins](https://github.com/OpenChronicle/plugins); deploy by symlink/copy into core's plugin dir. Plugins can register **mode prompt builders** (`ModePromptBuilder` protocol) to override system prompts when a conversation is in their mode
- **Routing**: Provider/model selection via pools (fast, quality, nsfw) with fallback support
- **Scheduler**: Core service in `application/services/scheduler.py` (not a plugin)
- **Discord**: Interfaces driver in `interfaces/discord/` (optional extra, not a plugin)
- **MCP Server**: Interfaces driver in `interfaces/mcp/` (optional extra, 30 tools, FastMCP)
- **HTTP API**: Interfaces driver in `interfaces/api/` (FastAPI, 39 REST endpoints, auto-starts with `oc serve`)
- **OpenAI Compat**: `interfaces/api/routes/openai_compat.py` — `/v1/models` + `/v1/chat/completions` (streaming + non-streaming) for Open WebUI and other OpenAI-compatible clients
- **MoE Execution**: `application/services/moe_execution.py` — Mixture-of-Experts consensus strategy (`--moe` flag)
- **Asset Management**: `domain/models/asset.py` + `application/services/asset_storage.py` — filesystem storage, SHA-256 dedup, generic entity linking
- **Embedding Service**: `application/services/embedding_service.py` — hybrid FTS5+cosine search via RRF, `EmbeddingPort` (stub/OpenAI/Ollama adapters), `OC_EMBEDDING_PROVIDER` env var

## Conventions

**Naming:**

- Event types: dot-separated lowercase (`llm.requested`, `task.completed`)
- Task types: use `plugin.invoke` with handler in payload (not dotted task types)
- Handler names: dot-separated lowercase (`story.draft`)
- Error codes: SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE (`INVALID_ARGUMENT`, `BUDGET_EXCEEDED`)

**Patterns:**

- All task handlers are async functions
- Strict typing enforced by mypy
- Domain models use `@dataclass`
- Tests use pytest fixtures; integration tests marked with `@pytest.mark.integration`
- Not-found conditions raise `NotFoundError` (from `domain/exceptions.py`), caught globally → HTTP 404
- Validation failures raise `ValidationError` (aliased `DomainValidationError` to avoid Pydantic collision), caught globally → HTTP 422
- Global exception handlers in `interfaces/api/app.py` eliminate per-route try/except
- Pydantic `Field()` constraints on request bodies; `Query()` constraints on query parameters
- Use `utc_now()` from `domain/time_utils.py` for current UTC time (not inline `datetime.now(UTC)`)
- Use `parse_csv_tags()` from `application/config/env_helpers.py` for comma-separated tag parsing
- Error code string values are `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE` (e.g., `"TIMEOUT"`, `"PROVIDER_ERROR"`)

**Secrets:**

- Zero secrets in repo (enforced by `test_no_secrets_committed.py`)
- Use `.env.local` (git-ignored) or `config/` directory for secrets
- Test placeholders: `changeme`, `replace_me`, `your_key_here`, `test-key`

## OpenChronicle Memory Integration

OC is available as an MCP server. It provides persistent memory that
survives context compression and session boundaries. **Use it.**

Context compression loses the "why" — decisions made, approaches
rejected, working state, user preferences expressed mid-session. The
status doc (`CODEBASE_ASSESSMENT.md`) tracks project-level state but
not conversational context. OC memory fills that gap.

### Setup

Configure in `.claude/settings.json` (project-level):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "openchronicle": {
      "command": "oc",
      "args": ["mcp", "serve"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Project Identity

Use `project_id: "0db2b2ff-f995-4f59-b059-0fae5c78909d"` in all `memory_save`
calls. This is a FK to the projects table — freeform strings will fail.

If the DB is recreated, create a new project with `project_create` and update
this UUID.

### Session Protocol Addition

After the standard session protocol (Serena onboarding, status doc,
CLAUDE.md sprint), add:

- Call `memory_search` with keywords relevant to the current task or
  the user's first message. Review results for prior decisions,
  rejected approaches, and working context from previous sessions.

This step is **especially critical after context compression**, where
the compression summary is a lossy snapshot. OC memory is the lossless
record.

### When to Save

Call `memory_save` when any of these happen during a session:

- **Decision made.** Architecture, design, or approach chosen. Include
  what was decided, alternatives considered, and the reasoning.
- **Approach rejected.** Something was tried and didn't work. Save what
  it was, why it failed, and what replaced it.
- **Milestone completed.** A feature or significant unit of work is done.
  Summarize what was built and any non-obvious gotchas.
- **User preference expressed.** The user states a workflow preference,
  convention, or standing instruction that isn't already in CLAUDE.md
  or working-style.md.
- **Scope change.** The user redirects mid-task. Save what changed and
  why, so future sessions don't re-tread the old path.
- **Pre-compression.** If a session is getting long (many tool calls,
  complex multi-step work), proactively save working context — what
  we're doing, where we are in it, what's left. Don't wait to be asked.
  There is no hook for compression; the only mitigation is saving early.

**Tagging convention:**

| Tag | When |
| ----- | ------ |
| `decision` | Architectural or design decisions |
| `rejected` | Approaches tried and abandoned |
| `milestone` | Completed work summaries |
| `context` | Working state snapshots (proactive saves) |
| `convention` | Patterns, preferences, recurring gotchas |
| `scope` | Scope changes and reprioritizations |

Pin memories that represent standing rules or conventions.

**Don't save:**

- Routine file edits or commands (too granular, no retrieval value)
- Anything already captured in `docs/CODEBASE_ASSESSMENT.md`
- Speculative plans that haven't been confirmed by the user

### When to Load

Call `memory_search` at these points:

- **Session start / post-compression.** Search for the current task
  topic. This is non-negotiable after compression.
- **Before starting a new area of work.** Check if prior context exists.
- **When something feels familiar.** If a problem seems like it was
  discussed before, search before re-deriving from scratch.

### Tools to Use / Avoid

| Tool | Use | Notes |
| ------ | ----- | ------- |
| `memory_save` | **Yes** | Primary persistence mechanism |
| `memory_search` | **Yes** | Primary retrieval mechanism |
| `memory_list` | Occasionally | Browse recent memories when search terms are unclear |
| `memory_pin` | Yes | Pin standing conventions and rules |
| `memory_update` | Yes | Update content/tags of existing memories |
| `context_recent` | Occasionally | Catch up on prior OC activity |
| `health` | Rarely | Diagnostics only |
| `conversation_ask` | **Never** | Routes through a second LLM — you ARE the LLM |
| `conversation_*` | **No** | Not needed for Claude Code use case |

### Known Gaps

- **No compression hook.** We can't detect when compression is about to
  happen. Mitigation: save-as-you-go discipline.
- **Search is keyword-based by default.** Set `OC_EMBEDDING_PROVIDER`
  to enable hybrid semantic+keyword search. Without it, quality depends
  on good content and tags. Write memories as if future-you is searching
  for them with obvious keywords.
