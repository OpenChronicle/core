## 🎯 Task Categories

### 🔥 Critical Priority
- Legal and liability protection framework
- Content risk tagging and classification
- MVP completion for v0.1.x release

### 🚀 High Priority
- Character consistency engine
- Character interaction dynamics
- Emotional stability and gratification loop prevention
- Storypack importer (see `.copilot/project_status.json` for current status)

### 📋 Medium Priority
- Character Q&A mode
- Motivation-driven response weighting
- Character conflict engine
- Character mutation lifecycle

### 💡 Low Priority / Future
- Image generation integration
- Narrative heatmap generator
- What-if forking engine
- Anonymous story analytics

## 🔄 Task Lifecycle

1. **Planned** - Initial concept and requirements defined
2. **In Development** - Active implementation work
3. **Testing** - Implementation complete, testing in progress
4. **Review** - Code review and validation phase
5. **Complete** - Fully implemented and merged
6. **Deferred** - Postponed to future milestone

## 📊 Status Tracking

Tasks are tracked in `task_registry.json` with the following metadata:
- **ID**: Unique task identifier
- **Title**: Descriptive task name
- **Status**: Current development phase
- **Priority**: Critical, High, Medium, Low
- **Dependencies**: Required prerequisites
- **Assignee**: Development lead (if applicable)
- **Estimated Effort**: Time/complexity estimate
- **Target Milestone**: Release version

## 🔧 Usage Guidelines

### For Developers
1. Check `task_registry.json` for current priorities
2. Review dependencies before starting new tasks
3. Update status when moving between phases
4. Document implementation decisions in task files

### For Project Management
1. Use `priority_matrix.json` for sprint planning
2. Track milestone progress via `mvp_roadmap.md`
3. Review and adjust priorities based on user feedback
4. Maintain clear dependency relationships

### For GitHub Copilot
- Reference task files for implementation context
- Follow established patterns from completed tasks
- Consider safety and legal requirements for all features
- Maintain consistency with architectural decisions

## 🎯 Current Sprint Focus

**Target: MVP v0.1.x Release**
- [ ] Complete legal liability framework
