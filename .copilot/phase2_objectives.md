# Phase 2: Configuration Centralization & Advanced Testing

## Current Session Progress Summary
- ✅ **Phase 1 JUST COMPLETED**: CLI Structure Consolidation & Utilities Migration
- 🎯 **Next Focus**: Configuration Management & Testing Infrastructure Enhancement

## Phase 2 Objectives

### 1. Configuration Centralization with Pydantic Settings
**Goal**: Replace multiple config managers with unified, type-safe configuration system

**Current State Analysis**:
- Multiple config files: `config/cli_config.json`, `config/system_config.json`, etc.
- Multiple config managers in CLI layer
- No centralized validation or type safety

**Target State**:
- Single pydantic-settings based configuration system
- Type-safe configuration with validation
- Environment variable support
- Centralized configuration management

### 2. Enhanced Testing Infrastructure
**Goal**: Expand test coverage and improve test quality

**Current Opportunities**:
- Expand mypy coverage to include more modules
- Add integration tests for CLI commands
- Performance regression tests
- Enhanced mock interfaces

### 3. Import Structure Validation
**Goal**: Ensure our Phase 1 import cleanup remains pristine

**Validation Tasks**:
- Verify no circular imports
- Confirm clean hexagonal boundaries
- Validate architectural layer separation

## Implementation Priority

### Priority 1: Configuration Centralization (HIGH IMPACT)
1. Create unified pydantic-settings configuration
2. Replace CLI config managers
3. Add environment variable support
4. Centralize all configuration validation

### Priority 2: CLI Testing Enhancement (MEDIUM IMPACT)
1. Add integration tests for CLI commands
2. Test our newly migrated utilities
3. Validate cross-platform compatibility

### Priority 3: Architecture Validation (LOW IMPACT, HIGH VALUE)
1. Automated architecture boundary checking
2. Import structure validation
3. Dependency graph analysis

## Expected Outcomes
- Single source of truth for all configuration
- Type-safe configuration management
- Enhanced test coverage for CLI functionality
- Automated architecture compliance validation
- Improved developer experience with better IDE support

## Ready to Begin Phase 2?
The foundation from Phase 1 is solid. Let's build on our CLI consolidation success!
