# 🔍 Full-Text Search (FTS5) System

## 🎯 Goals
- Enable SQLite FTS5 for memory and scene searching
- Provide fast, semantic content search across all story data
- Support advanced query operators and ranking
- Integrate with existing scene labeling and bookmark systems
- Foundation for content discovery and story analysis

## 📋 Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: FTS5 Database Schema
- [ ] Create FTS5 virtual tables for scenes and memory
- [ ] Set up automatic content indexing triggers
- [ ] Add search relevance scoring and ranking
- [ ] Implement index maintenance and optimization

### Phase 2: Search Engine Core
- [ ] Create `search_engine.py` with FTS5 integration
- [ ] Implement query parsing and sanitization
- [ ] Add search result ranking and filtering
- [ ] Support for complex search operators (AND, OR, NOT, quotes)

### Phase 3: Content Indexing
- [ ] Index scene inputs, outputs, and labels
- [ ] Index memory snapshots and flags
- [ ] Index character data and canon references
- [ ] Add incremental indexing for new content

### Phase 4: Search Interface
- [ ] Create search API with multiple query types
- [ ] Add search result highlighting and snippets
- [ ] Implement search history and saved searches
- [ ] Integration with timeline and bookmark systems

## 🔧 Technical Details

### FTS5 Virtual Tables
```sql
-- Scene content search
CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE scenes_fts USING fts5(
    scene_id UNINDEXED,
    input,
    output,
    scene_label,
    content='scenes',
    content_rowid='rowid'
);

-- Memory search
CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE memory_fts USING fts5(
    scene_id UNINDEXED,
    memory_data,
    flags,
    content='memory_snapshots',
    content_rowid='rowid'
);

-- Triggers for automatic indexing
CREATE TRIGGER scenes_fts_insert AFTER INSERT ON scenes
BEGIN
    INSERT INTO scenes_fts(scene_id, input, output, scene_label)
    VALUES (new.scene_id, new.input, new.output, new.scene_label);
END;
```

### Search Engine Architecture
```python
class SearchEngine:
    def __init__(self, story_id):
        self.story_id = story_id
        self.init_fts_tables()
    
    def search_scenes(self, query, limit=10, offset=0):
        """Search scenes with FTS5 ranking"""
        
    def search_memory(self, query, limit=10, offset=0):
        """Search memory snapshots and flags"""
        
    def search_all(self, query, limit=10, offset=0):
        """Unified search across all content"""
        
    def get_search_suggestions(self, partial_query):
        """Auto-complete and search suggestions"""
```

## 🎯 Success Criteria

### Core Functionality

## 🏗️ Implementation Notes

### Dependencies
- SQLite 3.35+ (for FTS5 support)
- Python 3.8+ (for typing and performance features)
- Integration with existing `database.py` and `scene_logger.py`

### Performance Considerations
- Use FTS5 auxiliary functions for ranking and snippets
- Implement lazy loading for large result sets
- Consider search result caching for common queries
- Monitor index size and optimize storage

### Security Considerations
- Sanitize search queries to prevent injection attacks
- Implement rate limiting for search requests
- Consider access controls for sensitive content
- Validate and escape search result highlights

This Full-Text Search system will significantly enhance OpenChronicle's content discovery capabilities, making it easier for users to navigate and analyze their stories while providing developers with powerful tools for content analysis and management.
