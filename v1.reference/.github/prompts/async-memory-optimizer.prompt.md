ROLE: You are optimizing OpenChronicle's async memory subsystem for narrative coherence and performance under heavy scene generation loads.

SCOPE: Memory performance optimization, caching strategies, and async operation efficiency.

OPENCHRONICLE MEMORY ARCHITECTURE:
- **MemoryOrchestrator**: Sync memory operations with async compatibility wrappers
- **AsyncMemoryOrchestrator**: Native async operations with caching and lazy loading  
- **Memory Components**: Character memory, world state, scene context, snapshot management
- **Synchronization**: Memory-scene coordination for narrative consistency
- **Persistence**: Multiple backends (filesystem, database) with async repository patterns

CRITICAL PERFORMANCE PATTERNS:

✅ **Memory-Scene Synchronization**: Always update memory before logging scenes
✅ **Async Operation Chains**: Use await throughout async memory operations  
✅ **Caching Strategy**: LRU cache with configurable TTL for frequently accessed memories
✅ **Lazy Loading**: Load memory components on-demand for large stories
✅ **Batch Operations**: Group memory updates for efficiency

PERFORMANCE BOTTLENECKS TO IDENTIFY:

🔍 **Latency Issues**:
- Synchronous I/O in async contexts
- Missing cache hits on repeated memory access
- Inefficient memory serialization/deserialization
- Blocking operations in async memory chains

🔍 **Memory Usage Issues**:
- Memory leaks in long-running narrative sessions
- Unbounded cache growth
- Duplicate memory objects in cache
- Inefficient character memory storage

🔍 **Consistency Issues**:
- Race conditions in concurrent memory updates
- Memory-scene synchronization violations
- Stale cache entries after memory updates
- Inconsistent async/sync operation results

OPTIMIZATION FOCUS AREAS:

1. **Async Operation Performance**
   - Validate proper async/await usage throughout memory operations
   - Identify blocking I/O operations in async contexts
   - Assess async operation chaining and error propagation
   - Review AsyncMemoryOrchestrator vs MemoryOrchestrator usage patterns

2. **Caching Effectiveness**
   - Analyze cache hit rates and TTL effectiveness
   - Evaluate cache size and eviction policies
   - Review cache invalidation on memory updates
   - Assess cache memory usage and garbage collection

3. **Memory Operation Latency**
   - Profile memory load/save operation performance
   - Identify serialization/deserialization bottlenecks
   - Analyze database/filesystem I/O patterns
   - Review memory snapshot creation and restoration

4. **Narrative Coherence Under Load**
   - Validate memory consistency during concurrent scene generation
   - Assess memory-scene synchronization performance
   - Review rollback operation efficiency
   - Analyze memory state consistency across character interactions

5. **Scalability Analysis**
