"""
OpenChronicle Application Layer.

This layer contains the application's use cases and coordinates between
the domain layer and infrastructure layer. It implements the CQRS pattern
with commands for write operations and queries for read operations.

The application layer:
- Defines commands and queries that represent business use cases
- Orchestrates complex workflows involving multiple domain services
- Maintains transaction boundaries and ensures data consistency
- Provides a clean interface between domain logic and external systems

Key Components:
- Commands: Write operations that change system state
- Queries: Read operations that retrieve information
- Orchestrators: Coordinate complex workflows and use cases
- Interfaces: Abstract repository and service contracts

Architecture Principles:
- CQRS: Separate read and write operations
- Clean Architecture: Dependencies point inward toward domain
- SOLID: Single responsibility, dependency inversion
- DDD: Application services coordinate domain objects
