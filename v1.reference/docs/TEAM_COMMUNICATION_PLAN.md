## 👥 Team Responsibilities

### All Developers

#### Immediate Actions (Aug 10-12)
- [ ] **Update development environment**
  ```bash
  make dev-install  # Install new tooling
  ```
- [ ] **Familiarize with new quality tools**
  ```bash
  make check        # Run all quality checks
  ```
- [ ] **Review migration documentation**
  - [Migration Tracking](./MIGRATION_TRACKING.md)
  - [Progress Board](./MIGRATION_PROGRESS_BOARD.md)
  - [Phase 0 Checklist](./phase0_checklist.md)

#### During Phase 1 (Aug 13-19) - CRITICAL COORDINATION PERIOD
- [ ] **Coordinate with architecture team before making changes to:**
  - Import statements (especially from `core.` package)
  - Entry points or main modules
  - Package structure modifications
- [ ] **Use feature branches for all work during this period**
- [ ] **Test changes thoroughly with full test suite**
- [ ] **Communicate blockers immediately**

#### Ongoing Best Practices
- [ ] **Use absolute imports only** (no relative imports)
  ```python
  # ✅ CORRECT
  from openchronicle.domain.entities.character import Character

  # ❌ WRONG
  from ..entities.character import Character
  ```
- [ ] **Add type hints to new code**
- [ ] **Maintain test coverage ≥ 85%**
- [ ] **Follow hexagonal architecture principles**

### Architecture Team

#### Responsibilities
- **Lead migration execution** across all phases
- **Review all structural changes** during Phase 1
- **Provide technical guidance** and resolve blockers
- **Maintain communication** with development team
- **Validate quality gates** at each phase

#### Escalation Contact
- **Primary**: Architecture Team Lead
- **Backup**: Senior Developer
- **Response Time**: 4 hours for blockers, 24 hours for questions

### QA Team

#### Responsibilities
- **Monitor test coverage** throughout migration
- **Validate quality gates** don't regress
- **Test migration changes** in development environment
- **Report performance issues** immediately

#### Key Metrics to Watch
- Test count: Currently 347, target 400+
- Coverage: Maintain ≥ 85%
- CI pipeline time: Currently ~8min, watch for regressions
- Test failure rate: Should remain at 0%

## 🚨 What Could Go Wrong & How We'll Handle It

### Scenario 1: Import Errors During Phase 1
**Symptoms**: Tests failing, import errors in development
**Response**:
1. Immediately notify architecture team
2. Revert to last known good commit if critical
3. Use incremental fix approach
4. Validate with full test suite before proceeding

### Scenario 2: Performance Regression
**Symptoms**: Slower test runs, application performance issues
**Response**:
1. Run performance baseline comparison
2. Identify regression source
3. Optimize or revert problematic changes
4. Re-establish performance baselines

### Scenario 3: Team Coordination Conflicts
**Symptoms**: Merge conflicts, duplicate work, confusion
**Response**:
1. Pause parallel work on affected areas
2. Architecture team coordinates resolution
3. Clear work assignment for remainder of phase
4. Enhanced communication for future phases

### Scenario 4: Quality Gate Failures
**Symptoms**: CI failing, coverage drops, type errors
**Response**:
1. Do not merge until resolved
2. Architecture team provides guidance
3. Address root cause, not just symptoms
4. Update processes to prevent recurrence

## 🤔 FAQ

### Q: Will this affect my daily development work?
**A**: Minimally. Phase 0 adds new tools but no breaking changes. Phase 1 requires coordination on import changes. Phases 2-3 are mostly transparent quality improvements.

### Q: What if I need to make urgent changes during Phase 1?
**A**: Coordinate with the architecture team immediately. We'll help you navigate the changes safely or provide guidance on timing.

### Q: How do I know if I'm following the new conventions correctly?
**A**: The pre-commit hooks and CI pipeline will catch most issues automatically. When in doubt, ask in the Slack channel or check the documentation.

### Q: What if the migration is taking longer than planned?
**A**: We have buffer time built into each phase. If delays occur, we'll communicate updated timelines immediately and adjust plans as needed.

### Q: How can I help make the migration successful?
**A**: Follow the communication guidelines, coordinate during Phase 1, maintain quality standards, and ask questions when uncertain. Your cooperation makes this possible!
