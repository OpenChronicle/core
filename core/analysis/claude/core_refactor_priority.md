# Core Module Refactoring Candidates

This document provides a line count overview of all scripts in the `core` directory and highlights candidates for refactoring and extraction into smaller scripts. Large files are more likely to benefit from modularization, improved maintainability, and easier testing.

## Line Count Summary

## Refactoring Recommendations

- **model_adapter.py**: At 1500+ lines, this is the top candidate. Consider extracting adapter classes, fallback chain logic, and configuration management into separate modules.
- **character_consistency_engine.py, memory_manager.py, scene_logger.py**: All are large and complex. Modularize core logic, utility functions, and data handling.
- **Files with 150+ lines**: Review for single-responsibility principle violations and opportunities to split into focused submodules.
- **Smaller files (<100 lines)**: Generally maintainable, but review for tightly coupled logic that could benefit from extraction.

## Next Steps
1. Prioritize refactoring for files marked **CRITICAL** and **HIGH**.
2. Use modularization patterns from `.copilot/patterns/core_module_pattern.py`.
3. Document refactoring progress in this file.
