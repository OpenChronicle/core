"""
Character Development Workflow Test

Tests the complete character development journey across multiple story sessions:
Character creation → Development through interactions → Growth and evolution → Long-term consistency

This workflow validates:
- Character initialization and base trait establishment
- Character development through story interactions
- Personality evolution and growth tracking
- Relationship development between characters
- Long-term character consistency across sessions
- Character decision-making patterns
- Emotional state tracking and development
